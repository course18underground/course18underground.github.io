## Subject Matter
* Most said that the class was broad, theoretical, disconnected, but interesting.

## Course Staff
* Most students said that the professor was **very friendly and lenient with extensions.**

## Lectures
* Some students believed that lectures were decently paced, though rushed at the end.
* Most students learned from a combination of lecture, official lecture notes, and/or Andrew Lin’s 18.212 notes.

## Problem Sets
* **Challenging.**
* Most students said that the problem sets required creativity and collaboration.
* Class had 3 problem sets of 6-7 problems, with some bonus questions.

## Exams
* No exams.

## Resources
* Official lecture notes were helpful, but sometimes outdated. 
* Online lecture notes (such as Andrew Lin’s) were helpful resource.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **opaque** but **lenient.**
* Doing all the required problems was equivalent to get an A.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *”Take this class if you like thinking about combinatorics and love collecting ‘great ideas’;
this class is full of them.”* 
> 2. *”TAKE THE CLASS”*
