## Realistic Prerequisites

- **18.01/18.02 is necessary**
- **Mathematical maturity**: some prior proof-writing experience is helpful. 18.100 suffices for proof-writing experience.
- **18.06** isn't necessary but makes the course easier.

## Subject Matter

- **Theoretical:** the course content was very theoretical. There wasn't much emphasis on solving differential equations.

## Course Staff

- **Caring and approchable**: the staff were always willing to put in the time to explain things.

## Lectures

- **Mixed opinions about pace**: some students found lectures fast, and some found lectures slow.
- Lectures were theoretical whereas recitations were about applying things learned in lecture.

## Problem Sets

- **Interesting**: Students found the problems sets interesting!
- The problem sets were structured with subparts and hints per problem, and the problems were greatly related to lecture content.

## Exams

- Practice tests were made avaliable and were useful.
- **Challenging**: the exams were challenging, but grading was lenient.

## Resources

- There was no textbook for the course.
- The instructor published lecture notes for each lecture.

## Grading

- It was not clear how other students were doing.
- Students either found grading fair or very lenient.

## Advice to Future Students

- If you just want an overview of differential equations then take 18.02. If you are interested in the theory then this class is great.
- Some prior experience with proofs and/or analysis is recomended.
