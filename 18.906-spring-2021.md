## Realistic Prerequisites

- **Content from 18.905** was very important. The material from 18.905 was quickly reviewed in the first few lectures.
- Knowing some **differential geometry** was useful as well. Sometimes, **algebraic geometry** appeared, but was not necessary for the class.

## Subject Matter

- The class was **purely theoretical**. However, the material was focused on geometry rather than category theory.

## Course Staff

- **Approachable**, and **willing to help students**.
- **Encouraged participation** in lectures.

## Lectures

- Lectures have a **fast pace**.
- Could use **lecture notes, textbook, and other references** to learn about material.

## Problem Sets

- 10 problem sets, around 5 problems per problem set.
- **Interesting and challenging** problems which could be done with knowledge from lectures.

## Exams

- No exams.

## Resources

- For each lecture, there were **lecture notes** and a list of parts of textbooks containing the material.
- No required textbook.

## Grading

- **Lenient and fair**, the distribution of grades was **transparent**.
- Grades were determined by average of **10 problem sets**.
- The A/B/C cutoffs were 80/65/50.

## Advice to Future Students

1.  _"Consider **who the professor will be** when taking this class. This will likely determine **how geometric or how category theory based** the class is."_
