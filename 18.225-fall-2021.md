## Realistic Prerequisites
* Strong background in combinatorics and familiarity with proofs. 
* Analysis and 18.701 are strongly recommended.
* Background in fourier analysis recommended. 

## Subject Matter
* **Theoretical** and **broad**.
* Useful for further study and **research**.

## Course Staff
* Students reported **approachable** course staff. 

## Lectures
* Lectures, problem sets and textbook **complemented each other well**. 
* Lectures were a bit fast but **good for understanding**. 

## Problem Sets 
* Psets were **challenging**, **long**, and **required creativity**. 
* Students reported working with classmates to complete psets.
* Psets **significantly helped students understand course content**. 

## Exams
* No exams.

## Resources 
* Professor Zhao held **OH each week a pset is due**; he provided substantial direction for psets. 
* Professor Zhao provided a textbook and list of references that complemented lectures and psets.
* Students reported a **desire for more office hours**. 

## Grading 
* Students reported **difficulty understanding what graders were looking for**.
* Students reported **tough grading** on psets.

## Advice to Future Students 
> 1. *”Try the starred problems! Especially if you're aiming for A or A+, be prepared to spend a LOT of time on starred problems, but they are absolutely worth attempting (even if you don't solve them).”* 
> 2. *"Understand that the class requires a lot of hours of work, even if you just want to pass."*
> 3. *”Try the starred problems! Especially if you're aiming for A or A+, be prepared to spend a LOT of time on starred problems, but they are absolutely worth attempting (even if you don't solve them).”*
