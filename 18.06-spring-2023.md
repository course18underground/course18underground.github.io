## Realistic Prerequisites
* Most students thought 18.02 was a good prerequisite.

## Subject Matter
* Most thought there was a good balance between theory and application.
* Some wished there could have been more intuitive explanations.

## Course Staff
* The course staff were described as approachable and understanding. Some students said that the course staff is approachable and responsive.
* Students said that Horning was a good lecturer and approachable.

## Lectures
* Most students believed that they learned from solving psets rather than lectures - and that this prepared them more for the tests. They believed that the lectures covered the concepts fine but still would have a hard time with the psets. 
* The textbook helped clarify the lectures.

## Problem Sets
* **Challenging.**
* Required time to think of applications of the concepts - OH and emailing TAs usually helped to go through problems on the pset.
* Lecture notes are generally helpful for the psets.
* Collaboration on psets with people was helpful.

## Exams
* The exams were considered difficult to finish on time but not totally unreasonable. 
* The problems were thought to be quite challenging, but many complained about the allotted time given the problems. 
* Some students said that as the class went on the exams got progressively more challenging.  

## Resources
* Students found Strang’s textbook helpful for both psets and exams.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **overall fair**.
* The grading was **lenient** on psets but harsh on exams.
* Some students felt that there could have been more transparency about grade cutoffs.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Mainly to read the textbook and attend both lecture and recitation because they all helped me with my understanding"* 
> 2. *”Take the time to read the textbook and understand the proofs"*
