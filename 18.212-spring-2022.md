## Realistic Prerequisites
* Proof experience and some linear algebra knowledge are very useful. The 18.701 prerequisite is very helpful.

## Subject Matter
* Students felt like the subject matter was largely theoretical and broad, but beautifully presented. Oftentimes there would be multiple proof presentations of the same problem, but combinatorially.

## Course Staff
* Postnikov is an extremely approachable and caring professor.

## Lectures
* The lectures were very well-paced. The professor goes through a lot of examples in order to explain each concept, which really helps.

## Problem Sets
* **Challenging.**
* Only three problem sets (posted once every 2-4) weeks. Needed to solve 6 out of 12 problems to get an A on the first two psets, 3 out of 12 for the last one.
* Psets were very challenging but also rewarding.

## Exams
* No exams.

## Resources
* The course closely follows Stanley’s textbook on combinatorics
* Postnikov posts his handwritten notes on the website after each lecture, and Andrew Lin’s notes are also available online

## Grading
* Students felt like the grading was lenient and the number of problems you needed to solve to get an A was always made clear.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *”You need to spend a lot of time thinking about the problem sets. The problems are not
easy, but that's why they're interesting. Expect to be completely confused about what you should do for a while, but don't give up. Keep on thinking about it and eventually you will solve many of the problems.”*
