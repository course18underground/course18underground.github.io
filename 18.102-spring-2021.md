## Realistic Prerequisites
* **Real Analysis**: Comfort with real analysis necessary. 18.100a necessary and 18.100b recommended. The professor provided additional background for students that have taken 18.100a.
* **Mathematical maturity**: some prior proof-writing experience is helpful.
* **18.06**: Some linear algebra is needed.

## Subject Matter
* **Theoretical:** The course content was theoretical.
* **Broad**: Certain topics were covered in depth such as Banach spaces, Lesbesgue measure, and Hilbert spaces.

## Course Staff
* **Caring and approachable**: The professor received nothing other than fantastic reviews. The staff answered questions on Piazza about course content and psets.

## Lectures
* Lectures were asynchronous and had accompanying notes. Students found the pace good and the lectures very interesting.

## Problem Sets
* **Appropriate Difficulty**: Students found the problem sets somewhat difficult but not too difficult.

## Exams
* The midterm was open notes and was very similar to the problem sets. 24 hours were given for the midterm and 48 hours were given for the final.

## Resources
* Melrose's Functional Analysis notes and Royden's Real Analysis were recommended.
* Several students referred to Andrew Lin's notes.

## Grading
* **Fair**: Grading is very fair but not necessarily lenient.
* 90+ guarantees an A and the grade distribution for the midterm indicated that there would be lots of A's.

## Advice to Future Students
* **Sleep**
* Take this course especially with Professor Rodriguez!
* A student recommended doing the psets right after the relevant lectures were posted.
