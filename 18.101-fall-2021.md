## Realistic Prerequisites
* **18.100A/B** is a hard prerequisite for the course. Topology (18.901) was also useful, though unnecessary.

## Subject Matter
* This topic is **foundational** and **theoretical**.
* It made one student more comfortable with using foundational tools in analysis.

## Course Staff
* The course staff was very **caring**.
* The TAs were generous with their time and helped improve understanding of the material.

## Lectures
* Sometimes the lectures were **hard to follow**, and handwriting was sometimes difficult to read.
* Many got lost during the fast-paced lectures.

## Problem Sets
* **Fair.**
* The psets were generally fair and easier than material presented in lectures, though they were quickly paced.
* Some found psets and office hours to be the most helpful in the class.

## Exams
* Only a final exam, with little feedback on how it went.

## Resources
* There was no specific textbook for the course, though students made use out of *Analysis on Manifolds* by Munkres, Guillemin’s notes, and Spivak’s *Calculus on Manifolds*.
* Professor Melrose also typed notes for the class throughout the semester, which students took advantage of.

## Grading
* The grading cutoffs were unclear, though grading on the psets was fair.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Keep good notes! Very notationally heavy."*
