## Subject Matter
* Highly **theoretical** and deep, though some useful applications in algorithms/computer science.

## Course Staff
* **Enthusiastic and engaging**. Approachable and caring course staff.

## Lectures Abigail
* Lectures were recorded, lectures followed the textbook closely, and there are recorded OCW lectures from prior year online.
* Textbook and recitation notes were available.

## Problem Sets 
* **Fun**, though occasionally required creativity.
