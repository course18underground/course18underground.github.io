## Realistic Prerequisites
*Knowing **complex analysis** and **fourier analysis** is greatly beneficial, but not required.

## Subject Matter
* The course was a more analysis-oriented approach to analytic number theory. The class went over some of the current techniques that researchers use in analytic number theory.

## Course Staff
* **Very caring and approachable**. Prof. Guth held office hours after every lecture.

## Lectures
* Most students believed that they learned mostly from lectures, which were presented very clearly. They believed that the psets were a tool to help understand the lecture material better.

## Problem Sets
* The problems were similar to proofs from the lecture. They were mainly to help digest the content from the lectures instead of needing new ideas.
* The problem sets contained optional problems.
* Collaboration on the more challenging psets was helpful.

## Exams
* There were **no exams**.

## Resources
* There were no textbooks, but there were scribed lecture notes from each lecture.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **fair** and **transparent**. Grades only depended on the problem sets.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Take this if it's offered again!"* 
> 2. *"I would advise students to attend lectures as this was the most efficient way for me to
learn the material."*
