## Realistic Prerequisites

- Hard prerequisite: **6.006**
- It is helpful to have some experience with **proof-writing and probability** (such as 6.042, 18.200, or 18.600).

## Subject Matter

- Course content is **largely theoretical**.
- Covers a breadth of algorithms and some useful applications.
- Lectures frequently jump around different topics without much build-up on previous material.

## Course Staff

- Students found the professors and TAs to be **very friendly and willing to help**.
- _"Course staff was extremely caring and approachable. The professors were engaging and fairly lenient."_
- _" Office hours with Bryan, Shangdi, Elizabeth and Yu were great! They all gave very insightful hints and were very approachable."_

## Lectures

- _"I learned a lot of the general ideas from lecture, and practiced applying the specifics in problem sets."_

## Problem Sets

- Many students described the psets as **challenging and interesting** and found that they required a good understanding of the lecture material.
- Time spent on psets varied from 5 to 12 hours.
- Students recommend working with others on the psets and going to office hours.

## Exams

- Most students found exam questions to be slightly easier than pset questions, but felt the exams were stressful and challenging due to the time pressure
- Practice quizzes are an accurate representation of the actual exam and useful for studying.
- Student also recommend reviewing the course notes and psets.
- _"Exams are stressful but still challenging and requiring creativity. They are fair and comprehensive."_

## Resources

- The course provided **lecture and recitation notes** which most students found helpful.
- The recommended **CLRS textbook** was a good supplement and students recommend using it for a better understanding of the material.

## Grading

- Most students found the grading to be **fair**.
- Grade cutoffs were released after the final exam.

## Advice to Future Students

> 1. _"It's a fun class! Even if you are not intending to do algorithms things, even if you disliked 6.006. Brush up on your probability skills before the class starts."_
> 2. _"Hop recitations until you find a good instructor - it makes a world of a difference. Office hours are great for psetting with others."_
> 3. _"Pset solutions are useful to look at, and doing all the practice quizzes helps."_
