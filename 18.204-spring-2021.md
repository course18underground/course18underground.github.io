## Realistic Prerequisites

- **Mathematical maturity:** having experience with proofs was important for reading math papers.
- **Linear algebra** and **combinatorics** were important overall, but the knowledge required depended on the topic chosen.

## Subject Matter

- **Broad range of topics:** in total, 16 different topics were studied deeply. Some topics were theoretical, and others were applied.
- Skills in **writing math papers** and **creating presentations** gained.

## Course Staff

- **Approachable** and **helpful** with questions about math or giving feedback.

## Lectures

- The lectures were **all student presentations**, and because the topics differed, sometimes presentations were difficult to follow.
- A lot of the material learned was from creating the presentation and writing the paper.

## Problem Sets

- **Short psets** which were **based on lectures**.
- The psets were **straight forward**, and could be done with talk summaries and notes.

## Exams

- There were 2 midterms which were **multiple choice**, consisting of 1 question for each topic written by the students.
- Since there were 16 topics, the midterms were **difficult to prepare for**, but were a **small portion of the grade**.

## Resources

- Each student got **3 topics** to present on.
- Topics had **textbooks and research articles** as source material.

## Grading

- The grading was **fair** and **transparent**, but getting an A took effort.
- The largest parts of the grade were the **talk** and **paper**.
- Grade cutoffs were around 90/80/70 for A/B/C.

## Advice to Future Students

1.  _"Start working on your talks **early**. Definitely do a **practice talk**."_
2.  _"Look into the project topics before you rank them so you know what you're getting yourself into. Also, **ask the instructors for feedback and schedule practice talks** if you can."_
