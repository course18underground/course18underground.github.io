## Realistic Prerequisites
* Some measure theory was realistic prerequisite.

## Subject Matter
* Very **theoretical**, with a deep study of probability with applications near the end.

## Course Staff
* Some students found the professor difficult to approach.

## Lectures
* Lectures were good, though psets and lecture notes were more useful.

## Problem Sets
* There were bi-weekly psets.
* Students found the problems difficult and spent about 15-20 hours on average across two weeks.

## Exams
* Exams were longer take-home psets that were closed note, with no collaboration.
* Students found the exams quite difficult.

## Resources
* Lecture notes were readily available and some textbooks were suggested.
* The Durrett textbook was mentioned as particularly useful.

## Grading
* No distribution was grade communicated, but students found the psets grading to be fair.
