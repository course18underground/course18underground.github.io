## Realistic Prerequisites
* Students recommended knowing **linear algebra** (18.06 or 18.703) and some set notation.

## Subject Matter
* Students found the subject to be theoretical and broad, but with some additional applications.

## Course Staff
* Students did not find the course staff to be approachable. 
* Class was additionally not canceled during when campus was closed due to weather.

## Lectures
* Lectures were very useful for understanding the course content.
* During the lectures, the professor would announce the problem set problems.
* One student would post these problems on the Canvas site, which the professor would not have done otherwise.

## Problem Sets
* The problem sets were described as long and tedious.
* Students found the lectures did not prepare them for the problem sets.

## Exams
* Students used the practice exams to prepare for the exams.

## Resources
* Students used the textbook and the course notes to learn the material.
* The textbook was “A First Course in Abstract Algebra” by John Fraleigh.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **incredibly strict** and **not transparent**.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *”Find a mentor to help you learn the material outside of class.”* 
> 2. *"Do not take this class with Prof. Kac."*
