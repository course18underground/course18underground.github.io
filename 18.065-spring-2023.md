## Realistic Prerequisites
* People recommend having taken **18.06** as a *hard prerequisite*. 
* The class does review linear algebra in the beginning but at a faster pace.

## Subject Matter
* Students described the content as **useful, foundational, broad, practical**, with a mix of *theoretical* and *applied* content.
* The ML part was covered in depth in certain areas.

## Course Staff
* There were no TAs/LAs, but the professor was **helpful, approachable, and enthusiastic** in office hours, and gave more detailed answers in office hours compared to Piazza.

## Lectures
* The professor mostly wrote notes as he taught, sometimes having demo code and slides.
* The students thought the lectures were the most helpful and the most referenced resource.
* Some students also found the textbook helpful.

## Problem Sets
* There were biweekly problem sets which students spent 4-10 hours on.
* Students thought the problems were relatively **straightforward and canonical**, though some students thought they were also interesting and fun.

## Exams
* There were no exams, but a final project.
* One student thought that the final project was the best part of the class.

## Resources
* The professor posted handwritten notes to canvas, and people found the textbook very helpful.
* There was an active Piazza.
* The textbook was less relevant later in the semester.

## Grading
* Students felt that the grading was **lenient but slow**.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *”Brush up on linear algebra skills if it has been a while since taking a course.”* 
> 2. *"Find a good group for the psets otherwise you will give up."*
