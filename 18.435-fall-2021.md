## Realistic Prerequisites
* The content of **linear algebra** was a necessary prerequisite (18.06, 18.700, or 18.701). Quantum mechanics and information theory were helpful but not necessary prerequisites.

## Subject Matter
* Fun material that is both theoretical and foundational.

## Course Staff
* **Responsive**. The course staff was very responsive on Piazza, and both the professor and TAs were approachable and willing to put in the time to help students.

## Lectures
* Lectures were hard to follow.
* **Lecture notes** and **textbooks** helped clarify the material in lectures.

## Problem Sets
* **Interesting.**
* Student’s opinions on the problem sets varied quite a bit, though most students agreed that the problems were interesting though occasionally difficult.
* Pset groups and office hours proved helpful in completing the homework.

## Exams
* There was a midterm for this exam.
* Most found the exams easier than problem sets, though pretty stressful.

## Resources
* The class used Nielsen and Chuang’s “Quantum Computation and Quantum Information”, as well as detailed lecture notes provided by Professor Shor.
* The lecture notes were useful for problem sets, and the textbook to some felt dense.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **fair** and **transparent**.
