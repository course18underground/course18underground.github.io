## Realistic Prerequisites
* **Proof experience** and **mathematical maturity** are **extremely important**. This is where the 18.100B soft prereq is most useful.
* It is helpful to have **some background in linear algebra** (18.06 material).

## Subject Matter
* Students thought the content was very cool.
* Course content was **very theoretical** and **abstract**, covering fundamentals of algebra and going deep into proofs.
* Students wanted more applications out of the class.

## Course Staff
* Course staff was very **approachable**, **understanding**, and **helpful**.
* Professor Poonen and the TA’s showed legitimate interest in student’s questions.

## Lectures
* The subject lectures covered all learning objectives.
* Many students, however, felt discomfort asking questions live during lectures.
* The pace of the class was marked in between “just right” and “too fast”.

## Problem Sets
* Many were content with the problem set and the rigor of it. 
* Many felt comfortable asking questions on the problem set to the TAs.
* Students generally found the psets **fun**, **challenging**, and **interesting**.
* Many found **collaboration absolutely necessary**.

## Exams
* Instead of exams, there were weekly open-book/open-Google quizzes. Many students found this format less stressful than traditional exams.
* The quizzes were **fair** and **covered the materials learned in class**.

## Resources
* The [textbook by Artin](https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Classic-Classics-Advanced-Mathematics/dp/0134689607/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=artin+algebra&qid=1611598157&s=books&sr=1-1) is great, and actually reading it helped a lot.
* Math Stack Exchange and [Andrew Lin’s 18.701 notes](https://www.mit.edu/~lindrew/18.701.pdf) online also helped some.

## Grading
* Grading was **fair** and **transparent**, and some even thought it was **pretty generous**.
* 85% of the grade was from psets, and 15% was from the quizzes.
* 90% guaranteed an A- or above, 80% a B-, 70% a C-.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"textbook, pretty spicy"*
  2. *"proofs. **HAVE A PSET PARTNER**"*
  3. *"**Read the textbook**, for sure. Also, watching the first couple of lectures during Summer before the course is super helpful since **this class goes quite fast** (coming from someone who has some proof experience, but did not take 100A/100B)."*
  4. *"Work on psets with other students, absolutely. It’s **easy to make false assumptions or errors in logical reasoning, and discussing the material of the pset** (not just the questions themselves, but even facts that are 'unrelated' to the questions) **with others can illuminate lots of these mental lapses**."*
