## Realistic Prerequisites
* **18.901** was the only necessary prerequisite. Some felt that topics in 18.905 may have been helpful, specifically homology. 

## Subject Matter
* Most thought the content was very theoretical and specific. In Spring 2022, the main focus was on knot theory.  

## Course Staff
* Several students thought the professor (Anthony Conway) could be curt at times. Most agreed that he was kind and eager to engage with students. 

## Lectures
* The lectures were all **student presentations**. Some were helpful, and others hard to follow.
* **Notes** were used for reference. 

## Problem Sets
* **Short.**
* One problem per pset, based on the lecture.
* Students generally considered psets to be very straightforward.

## Exams
* No exams.

## Resources
* Typed notes from each student presentation were combined into a collaborative set of **class notes**.
* **Textbook links** were shared.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **fair** and **transparent**, though they had to email the professor to see where points were taken off.
* Most students did quite well in the class.
* Grade cutoffs were 90/80/70 for A/B/C.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"This class will take more time than you expect."*
> 2. *"If Knot Theory by Professor Conway appears again, take it! It's an amazing course. Remember to go to office hours even if you don't have a question, as Conway can seem curt over email, so getting to know him in office hours is very helpful for communication."*
