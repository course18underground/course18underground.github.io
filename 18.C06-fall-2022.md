## Realistic Prerequisites
* Some programming background is highly recommended, such as Python in 6.100A. 
* General calculus, such as 18.01 and 18.02, is also recommended. 

## Subject Matter
* Most felt that this class was deep and foundational. 
* Students generally agree that the class is mostly applied, but this didn't translate to practical in some cases. 

## Course Staff
* Reviews for the course staff were mixed. 
* Some students felt that the course staff were not approachable, and unhelpful at times on Piazza and in person, especially when it came to Julia programming questions. 
 * Some students felt that the course staff were engaging and very understanding. 

## Lectures
* Students agree that the lectures were essential for learning the material. 
* Lectures were recorded. 

## Problem Sets
* **Challenging.**
* Lectures were generally not enough to fully prepare for the psets, and often felt too disconnected from the lecture material.

## Exams
* The exams were considered difficult to finish due to time pressure. However, the letter cutoffs were adjusted appropriately
* Problems usually ranged from easy to very difficult.

## Resources
* Lectures were recorded, and lecture notes from a previous semester were made available on Canvas.
* There is no textbook. 

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **very fair** and **generous**. 
* Students complained about the amount of time for grades to come out. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Go to lecture and especially recitations, do not skip."*
> 2. *"Invest time into learning Julia at the very beginning."*
> 3. *"Consider taking plain 18.06 instead."*
