## Realistic Prerequisites
* **18.600** knowledge is required, although some students thought classes such as 6.042 or 18.05 gave the necessary background.
* Some knowledge of linear algebra and exposure to analysis was necessary.

## Subject Matter
* Content was **mostly theoretical**.
* Most of the theorems weren’t proved in class.

## Course Staff
* Most found the course staff was **approachable and caring**.

## Lectures
* Lectures could be **very vague** and confusing.
* Many students found lectures to be **engaging** and had high participation.
* Students recommended using OCW to supplement lectures.

## Problem Sets
* **Difficulty varied** from problem set to problem set.
* Oftentimes were direct applications of the theorems presented in class.

## Exams
* Exams were **straightforward** and standard.
* Some students complained on the large weight given to individual true/false questions, where 10% of your grade was lost for a wrong answer to one of the true/false questions.
* One student thought the lack of an equation sheet required a lot of memorization before exams.

## Resources
* Many thought the OCW was a useful supplement to lectures.
* There was no official textbook.
* Lecture slides and a set of typed notes were made available, though many found the notes to not be helpful.

## Grading
* Students generally found the grading to be **lenient and fair**.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Brush up on your basic linear algebra and review probability distributions."* 
> 2. *"Only take this class if you want to get a theoretical foundation, and expect to learn for yourself, as you can't really rely on the staff."*
> 3. *”A great course for introduction to statistics. It gets easier after the first two weeks.”*
