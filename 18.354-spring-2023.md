## Realistic Prerequisites
* The content of **18.02** was a necessary prerequisite. 
* Others recommended 18.03, especially stability conditions of ODEs. 
* MATLAB or other programming experience was useful.

## Subject Matter
* Very applied in that one is modeling physical things (such as diffusion, fluid dynamics, etc). 
* Some felt the class was too broad.

## Course Staff
* **Nice and encouraging**. Students recommended taking the class with this instructor.

## Lectures
* The lectures were clear, thorough, and followed the lecture notes almost exactly.
* **Problem sets** were helpful for learning the material.

## Problem Sets
* **Helpful.**
* The problem sets helped clarify content, and the lecture notes prepared students for the problem sets.

## Exams
* No exams.

## Resources
* The course notes were detailed and even covered some material not in class. The lecture notes were good.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **lenient**.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"I wouldn't take this if I actually wanted to learn nonlinear dynamics, but if you like physics and partial differential equations this class could be fun."*
