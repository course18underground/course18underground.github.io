* Students mentioned that the lectures were the **best resource** in learning for this class.

## Problem Sets
* Most students felt like problem sets were **challenging** but **fun**.
* Reinforced what was being taught in lecture.

## Exams
* Both exams were **take-home** exams.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Take this course if you enjoyed 18.901 and have learned group theory/algebra."* 
> 2. *”Brush up on commutative algebra before you take this class, especially if you haven't taken anything beyond 18.701.”*
> 3. *"Definitely take this class if you have any interest in doing more advanced topology! It is extremely fun, interesting, and changes the way you think about topology. It is also the gateway to many topics in advanced math. I especially recommend taking the class with Prof. Gavela as he is excellent."*
