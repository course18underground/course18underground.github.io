## Realistic Prerequisites
* Students said 18.02 and 18.100x are hard prerequisites. 
* Students recommended having an understanding of 18.901.

## Subject Matter
* Students thought the subject material was theoretical, but not overly abstract. 
* Students felt like the material could be applied to physics and math, but it is ‘definitely a pure math class’.

## Course Staff
* Prof. Kleene was seen as friendly, and approachable. 
* Prof. Kleene was willing to meet online for those who needed extra help. 

## Lectures
* Students found the lectures to be the correct speed or slightly fast. Students learned mostly from these lectures.

## Problem Sets
* Students found the problems to be analytic and straightforward. 
* Students used lectures to prepare for the psets, and spent about 5 hours a week completing these.

## Exams
* The exams were relatively fair. 
* The professor (Stephen Kleene) posted lots of sample questions that could appear on an exam. 
* Students recommended going over class definitions and problem set solutions to prepare.

## Resources
* Many referred to the textbook ‘Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces’ by Manfredo do Carmo, but it was only loosely followed in lecture.
* Lecture notes were also used by students.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **incredibly fair** and **reasonable**.
* Students expect over half the class will receive A’s.  

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"This class is great if you want a glimpse of what differential geometry is about."* 
> 2. *"Brush up on your topology and analysis knowledge before taking this class."*
