## Realistic Prerequisites
* Knowledge of **18.705** and **18.725** is important. Knowledge of other fields like differential geometry and complex analysis are helpful for intuition.

## Subject Matter
* The modern approach to algebraic geometry.

## Course Staff
* Some students found the professor/TA hard to reach.
* Staff was understanding about extension requests.

## Lectures
* Students found the lectures **good for guiding intuition** and a highlight of the class.
* **Textbooks** were also helpful.

## Problem Sets
* The problem sets were **long but reasonable in difficulty.**
* Many problems were from the textbook.
* Collaboration was helpful.

## Exams
* There was an open book final.

## Resources
* The lectures followed Vakil’s **The Rising Sea - Foundations of Algebraic Geometry**, which students found helpful and well-written.
* Some students also found referring to Hartshorne helpful.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **lenient**.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Read the textbook and nail the foundations. Also, have the right attitude: appreciate the beauty of the subject as much as you can."*
> 2. *"Be ready to grind."*
