## Realistic Prerequisites
* Students found that the class required a higher level of mathematical maturity than indicated by the stated prerequisites.

## Subject Matter
* Students found the subject to be very **theoretical**. 
* The course covered the structure theory of semisimple Lie algebras, as well as minor discussions of representation theory and references to physics.

## Course Staff
* Students found the course staff **approachable**.

## Lectures
* The lectures were organized, but not incredibly thorough. 
* The professor used problem sets as verifications of simple assertions from the lectures.

## Problem Sets
* Students with less algebra background found the problem sets challenging, while others found them to be more simple and straightforward. 
* Students found the problem sets important for understanding and appreciating the material.

## Exams
* The course had no exams.

## Resources
* The main resource was notes from the 2010 version of the class.
 
## Grading
* Students found the problem set grading to be **harsh** yet otherwise very **fair**. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Look at the 2010 notes online to see if it’s for you."*
> 2. *"Good luck!."*
