## Realistic Prerequisites

-   **18.100** is a hard prerequisite.
-   Experience with proofs and some set theory knowledge is helpful.

## Subject Matter

-   The course material is **very theoretical**, **broad**, and **useful** in future topology courses.
-   _"More theoretical, and helped me better understand parts of 100B I was confused on. Allowed me another way to look at analysis which I found particularly useful."_

## Course Staff

-   The professor was kind but not a good lecturer.
-   Students did not have much interaction with the TAs.

## Lectures

-   Many students **did not find the lectures helpful** and studied from the textbook instead, which had similar content and was better organized.
-   Lectures were generally **difficult to follow**.

## Problem Sets

-   Problem sets were **doable**, but **sometimes tedious and challenging**.
-   Problems were from the textbook and generally well-chosen.

## Exams

-   Students felt prepared for the exams following the lectures.
-   Exams were **fair** and **did not require much creativity**.

## Resources

-   Students **highly recommend** the textbook _Topology_ by Munkres. This was the main resource many students used throughout the course.

## Grading

-   Grading policy was **generally clear**, but **not entirely transparent**. Also, grade cutoffs were not released.
-   Grading was sometimes **harsh and too semantic** on psets and exams.

## Advice to Future Students

 1. *"Quality of class is highly dependent on instructor; consider waiting for a better one in the fall."*
 2. *"Topology is an excellent class to take, but not with this professor."*
