## Realistic Prerequisites
* The content of **18.01** and **18.02** were necessary prerequisites. 
* The content of 18.06, or some linear algebra, was helpful but not necessary.

## Subject Matter
* Content was decently theoretical, but not rigorous. Some expressed interest in more connections to real world applications. 

## Course Staff
* **Very helpful and friendly.** TAs were especially approachable. 

## Lectures
* Most students learned from MITx or problem sets, rather than lectures. Lectures were 1-2 weeks behind required readings on MITx. 

## Problem Sets
* **Interesting.**
* Recitations, OH, and working collaboratively were effective ways of completing psets.
* Problems were mostly about proving theorems. 
* Lectures were not generally representative of content on psets.

## Exams
* The exams were considered to be very fair and straightforward. Some generally found the exams easier than problem sets. There were no practice materials given, but students found lectures and problem sets to be good study materials. 

## Resources
* No required textbooks.
* Readings and lectures from Professor Mattuck were available on MITx. 

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **very fair**.
* Some felt that graders took off too many points for minor errors. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Take advantage of MITx, it is a great resource for this class."* 
> 2. *"Go to office hours!"*
