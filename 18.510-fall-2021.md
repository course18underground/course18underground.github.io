## Realistic Prerequisites
* Experience with proofs and abstraction recommended.

## Subject Matter
* **Very theoretical**, though Cohn connects class to applied topics. 

## Course Staff
* **Caring and engaging**. Professor Cohn is **approachable and friendly** and helpful during office hours.

## Lectures
* Lectures were helpful and fast-paced; some interesting results were proved in psets. 
* Lectures, psets, and textbook/lecture-notes were all helpful in understanding the class. 

## Problem Sets 
* Problem sets were **fun**, **rewarding**, and **challenging**.
* Problem sets varied in difficulty.
* Lectures sufficiently prepared students for psets. 

## Exams
* The class had 2 open-book, 90 minute, take-home exams. 
* Students reported exams were **appropriately challenging** and **well-timed**. Psets were good preparation for exams. 

## Resources 
* Professor Cohn had **well-organized, well-written, complete set of lecture notes**. Students reported notes were sufficient for the class.

## Advice to Future Students 
> 1. *"Make use of office hours, communicate with your instructor, and don't be discouraged if you start off with a less-than-ideal grade. Finding pset partners also helps. "* 
> 2. *"Ask for help and accept Professor Cohn's offers for help."*
> 3. *”Look over notes before class.”*
