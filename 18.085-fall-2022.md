## Realistic Prerequisites
* There were no hard prerequisites for the class, but some students found that some background knowledge of **linear algebra** was helpful.
* Many students said that having some **programming experience in any language** was a huge help.

## Subject Matter
* Many thought it was somewhere between theory-heavy and application-heavy. Some wished that the real world applications discussed were more relevant, though. 

## Course Staff
* The professor and TAs were **caring** and very quick to respond to questions over email or in OH.

## Lectures
* Lectures were fast paced and well-structured, but stuck very strictly to the lecture notes.
* Some felt the lectures were not necessary because of this.
* Most said they learned the most from problem sets, but lectures were still helpful.

## Problem Sets
* PSets were **challenging**, but fun for most students.
* Students reported spending **4-10 hours** on PSets per week, and tended to work in small groups.
* Most of the content was from the lecture or lecture notes.
* Many PSets included a **programming** component.

## Exams
* The exams were **take-home**, but many reported that they were **very time-consuming**. 
* Most felt the lectures and PSets appropriately prepared them for the exams.

## Resources
* Most felt that **lecture notes** were the only necessary resource to do well in the class.
* Slides from lectures were also posted after class.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **fair** and **transparent**. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"I found this class to be very helpful with a good balance of time commitment to reward
in the form of subject matter understanding."* 
> 2. *"This class is useful for learning how to manipulate your coding language of choice."*
> 3. *”If you have to take a math class, this one gets it done and I think I got an A (unsure
because we have not taken final). But I did not learn a lot. I do not know if there are better math options so this may be your only choice.”*
> 4. *”Go to office hours! Review the review notes provided by the instructor! And try to get
the instructor to tell you the real-world rationale behind each of the pset problems, as it may help bring you greater motivation to learn it.”*
