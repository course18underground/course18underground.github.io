## Realistic Prerequisites
* The content of **18.100A/B/P/Q** was a necessary prerequisite, and experience with manifolds is a soft, but **helpful**, prerequisite. 
* There were some references to other areas of analysis such as functional analysis, topological concepts, and partial differential equations, but these were often blackboxed.
* Experience with smooth manifolds is expected, though he does go over the foundational knowledge the first week.

## Subject Matter
* More on the theoretical side, but very applicable to any number of other classes/research.

## Course Staff
* **Very friendly and approachable**. Both the instructor and the TA were helpful in office hours to learn the material and ask questions.

## Lectures
* Lectures were stimulating and interesting, though Professor Minicozzi was more than happy to slow down if anyone had questions or even just seemed confused!
* Be sure to speak up if you don’t understand something because he wants to help you learn!
* **Textbooks** helped clarify the lectures.

## Problem Sets
* **Reasonable.**
* The problemsets were very reasonable, though occasionally required creativity/tricky solutions.
* Sometimes the problemsets were seen as a “little light”, but efficiently helped students practice the concepts they had learned about in class.

## Exams
* There were no exams.

## Resources
* Used do Carmo’s “Riemannian Geometry” and his other book “Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces” was helpful for background/problemsets.
* There were also course notes that were provided.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **incredibly fair** and **reasonable**. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *”Go to class and do the work and you’ll have a great time!* 
> 2. *"Enjoy this class – it’s a lot of fun.”"*
