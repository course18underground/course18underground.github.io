## Realistic Prerequisites
* **18.701** is a hard prerequisite.
* **18.901** is a soft prerequisite but helpful.
* Familiarity with some concepts from **18.702** such as commutative rings, modules, and manifolds is **very helpful**.

## Subject Matter
* The class was very **theoretical**. 
* Students mentioned that there are many interesting applications to algebraic topology and this class covers the bases well and is **useful for those hoping to explore the field further**.


## Course Staff
* Professor Hahn was described as very **approachable** and **engaging**.

## Lectures
* Lectures were described as somewhat slow and easy to follow.
* Lectures focused on examples and told an interesting story.


## Problem Sets
* Problem sets were long, though were bi-weekly.
* Problems were generally described as **fun** and **challenging**. They helped solidify an understanding of the material.


## Exams
* There were no exams besides the final.

## Resources
* Lecture notes by Prof. Haynes Miller were most useful.
* Allen Hatcherâ€™s *Algebraic Topology* was used, but did not follow the class material as closely.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **fair** and **lenient**.
