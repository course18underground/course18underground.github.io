## Realistic Prerequisites
* The content of **18.01** and **18.02** were necessary prerequisites. **18.03** was useful in some places but was not required. 

## Subject Matter
* Good balance between theory and applications. Some wished more time was spent proving the theory, while others appreciated that the course covered applications relevant to physics and other subjects. 

## Course Staff
* Students found the course staff very friendly and helpful answering questions. 

## Lectures
* Lectures generally followed the online notes pretty closely. Most students felt that the lectures basically restated the notes with additional explanation, but were still helpful for solidifying understanding. 

## Problem Sets
* Most students found the psets to be long, time-consuming, and difficult. 
* Due to their length, psets are difficult to complete alone and students recommend working with others.
* Psets are helpful for preparing for the exams and are very relevant to the content of the course.

## Exams
* The exams were relatively fast-paced but the problems were considered very manageable. 
* Some students commented that the time pressure made the exams stressful.

## Resources
* There was no textbook.
* The course followed a set of notes available online. Students found them very helpful.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was fair but not transparent. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Ask lots of questions and don't be afraid to seek help from other students, but often sitting and struggling with problems is a great way to learn."* 
> 2. *"Take this class! Attend the lectures and read the notes after for things you are confused on."*
