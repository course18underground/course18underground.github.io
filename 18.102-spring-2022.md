## Realistic Prerequisites
* 18.100x is a hard prerequisite. Students recommend knowing some metric space theory, which is currently only taught in 18.100B/Q. 
* Students recommend knowing some linear algebra. 

## Subject Matter
* Students felt like the subject matter was very theoretical, but there were some applications regarding differential equations at the end of the course. 

## Course Staff
* Professor Etingof was very helpful in helping students work through questions. 
* Office hours were seen as very helpful when working through the problem sets.

## Lectures
* Lectures were seen as repetitions of the notes, and were sometimes very confusing to students. 
* Watching the recordings of the lectures helped clear up confusion.

## Problem Sets
* Some psets were very challenging, some were more straightforward. 
* Students spent anywhere from 5 to 10 hours on each pset.

## Exams
* Exams were stressful, as there were only 80 minutes for 5 problems.
* Students were given a set of midterm problems to help prepare, which were modified versions of what would appear on the exams. 

## Resources
* Students used notes from Prof. Richard Melrose
* Lectures were also recorded, so students watched them back to review material.

## Grading
* Grading was noted as **fair and transparent**. 
* Approximately 30% of the class receives an A, and over 80% of people get A’s and B’s. 
* Grading put a large emphasis on the final (45%).

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *”Go to office hours - the professor is very helpful.”*
> 2. *”Don’t underestimate the material, but it will be very rewarding!”*
