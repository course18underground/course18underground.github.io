## Realistic Prerequisites
* Students believe the content of 18.01 and 18.02 is required, and recommend having practice with proof writing. 

## Subject Matter
* Most thought the content was very theoretical.

## Course Staff
* Course staff were willing to answer questions. 
* Students wished there were more course staff to host more office hours. 

## Lectures
* Most students did not find the lectures helpful, and ended up learning the most from psets and the textbook. 

## Problem Sets
* Students found the psets to be comprehensive, and the correct level of difficulty. 
* Students spent 6 to 8 hours a week completing these psets.

## Exams
* Students found that the exams were much easier than the problem sets, but graded much stricter.
* Exams did not require a lot of creativity.

## Resources
* Students used the textbook (Lebl's Basic Analysis) and class recordings. 

## Grading
* Grading was described as fair for psets, and harsh for exams. 
* Students were unsure of grade cutoffs for the course.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Definitely take this class! I was afraid of pure math before taking it and I really liked it.”*
