## Realistic Prerequisites
* The content of **18.701** and **18.702** were very necessary prerequisites. Other than that, students found that exposure to category theory, algebraic geometry, or algebraic number theory helps a lot. 
* The class demands a high level of mathematical maturity.
* Previous experience with grad classes is recommended. 

## Subject Matter
* Students found the subject to be very **theoretical, broad and foundational**. 
* Part of the class seemed unmotivated without background knowledge of number theory, algebraic geometry, or algebraic topology.

## Course Staff
* Students found the course staff **approachable**.

## Lectures
* Some students felt that the lectures were somewhat disorganized and confusing. 
* Lecture content mostly followed the textbook, which students found incredibly helpful to read. 

## Problem Sets
* **Difficult yet fun.**
* Many problems are taken directly from Atiyah-MacDonald, and the book often gives (extensive) hints.
* After reviewing lecture notes and reviewing definitions, students found that problems were a matter of unraveling definitions. 

## Exams
* Students found the exams **reasonable** and tested content from the problem sets. 
* A practice exam was provided, which students felt was similar to the content of the real exam. 
* Some students felt time-pressure on the exams.

## Resources
* The main resource was Atiyah-MacDonald’s *Introduction to Commutative Algebra*, which students found to be incredibly helpful.
* Some students found Altman-Kleiman’s *A Term of Commutative Algebra*  to be useful as well.
 
## Grading
* Students found grading to be **fair** and **lenient**. 
* Problem sets had more than 100 points assigned, with grades capped at 100. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Only take this class if you are planning on studying algebra or something algebra-related."* 
> 2. *"General maturity with ideas in algebra and category theory goes a long way."*
