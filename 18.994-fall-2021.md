## Realistic Prerequisites
* The content of **18.02** was a necessary prerequisite. There was some material from linear algebra (18.06) as well, though most of this material was easy to find online or in the textbook.

## Subject Matter
* This course was helpful in learning some of the foundations in differential geometry without too much extraction given that most of the material took place on two-dimensional surfaces in three-pace.
* Some felt like the material was a bit too computation, but had lots of applications such as cartography, computer graphics, and especially physics.

## Course Staff
* **Very friendly and approachable**. The staff helped by being flexible with their availability for office hours and discussions which was nice.

## Lectures
* As a seminar, this course had lectures led by other students which resulted in variation in quality, but also a variation in teaching style.
* **Textbooks** helped clarify the material in lectures.

## Problem Sets
* **Challenging.**
* Some examples involved quite a bit of computation, and the non-computational problems became important theorems that were used later on in the course.
* Office hours and problemset groups helped a lot.

## Exams
* There were no exams for this class.

## Resources
* The class used Shifrin’s “Differential Geometry: A First Course in Curves and Surfaces”, which was made available online.
* The class follows the textbook pretty closely.
* One student also recommends the use of do Carmo’s book on differential geometry.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **incredibly fair** and **reasonable**.
