## Realistic Prerequisites
* **18.100** is a hard prerequisite, as this is an analysis class.
* Softer requirements include experience with manifolds and functional analysis. Students mentioned **18.101** and **18.102** as good supplements here.

## Subject Matter
* Most thought the class was **foundational and theoretical**, with more concrete results towards the end of the semester. 
* Some of the content has applications in physics, as well.

## Course Staff
* **Friendly**. Students mentioned both the professor and TA being very nice and able to make a good learning environment for all.

## Lectures
* Most said they got most of the content from the lectures, and supplemented with the provided lecture notes.
* Psets were useful for solidifying concepts, and helped in fully understanding lecture concepts.

## Problem Sets
* **Mixed results**: Some students reported the psets to be routine, and mostly made up of problems and results that were skipped in lecture.
* Others found the problems helpful but challenging, especially because of the many definitions and the amount of new material.
* Most found the psets to be helpful, as the problems connected to future lecture content.

## Exams
* **This class did not have exams.**

## Resources
* **Excellent lecture notes** The professor provided typed-up lecture notes with many references for further investigation.
* Most students consulted these notes after lectures.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **incredibly fair** and **reasonable**. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *”Attend class, read lecture notes, and discuss the class content with students, TA, and
professor.”* 
> 2. *"It is a very fun class but does require substantial mathematical maturity and familiarity
with a number of concepts in analysis. I recommend taking a solid time in advance to read the sections in the notes skipped in the lectures, as well as review references to other textbooks as advised in the notes."*
