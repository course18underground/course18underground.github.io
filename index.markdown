Welcome to the **Course 18 Underground**, maintained by the [MIT Council for Math Majors](mailto:comm-all@mit.edu) and the [MIT Undergraduate Math Association](http://uma.mit.edu/).

This goal of this guide is to serve undergrads and faculty in course 18 by compiling and recording detailed student feedback about math classes at MIT. 

We hope that students will find the guide useful when registering for subjects and recitation sections, and that faculty will consider the feedback detailed here in planning future terms.

This project is in its pilot stages as of Fall 2020, and we hope to expand course offerings soon!
