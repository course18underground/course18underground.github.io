# Welcome to the **Course 18 Underground**! 

---


Our goal is to serve undergrads and faculty in course 18 by compiling and recording detailed student feedback about math classes at MIT. 

We hope that students will find this project useful when registering for math subjects and recitation sections, and that faculty will consider the feedback detailed here in planning future terms.

**Spring 2023 underground subject evaluations are [now available](/spring2023)!** 

Please see the [FAQ page](/FAQ) if you have any questions.
