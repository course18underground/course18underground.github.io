## Realistic Prerequisites
* 18.02 and 18.03 are **hard prerequisites** for this course. Most students recommend knowing some basic programming and linear algebra.
* Being familiar with **MATLAB** is recommended, but not required.
## Subject Matter
* Most students thought it was a healthy mix between applied and theoretical.
* The first half of the course focused on linear algebra and was more theoretical, whereas the latter half was on optimization methods and was found to be more applied.  
* Most students thought the subject material would aid them in their research later on.


## Course Staff
* **Very friendly and approachable**. The professor was very helpful in office hours and on Piazza. 
* Prof. Durey was described as **very approachable** and **very willing** to help students learn.  

## Lectures
* Students found lectures most useful, and used psets and office hours to reinforce the information. 
* Some students used lecture notes, which were described as clear and well-written. 


## Problem Sets
* Students found the psets engaging and helped reinforce material from the lectures.
* Many seemed to find that most of the pset material was taken almost directly from past lectures.
* Students spent anywhere from 5 - 10 hours on the psets weekly.  

## Exams
* The exams were difficult to finish on time, and were of the **same difficulty** as the psets. 
* Students recommended the practice exams posted by Prof. Durey, as well as going over past problem sets. 
* Students spent between 3-5 hours preparing for an exam. 

## Resources
* Lecture notes were **incredibly helpful** to review concepts.
* Only a few used Prof. Strang’s textbook for the course, and others described it as **unnecessary**.

## Grading
* The grade was distributed out of 5 problem sets, 2 midterms, and a final project.
* Grading was fair, but grade cutoffs were **unclear**. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Go to office hours - they make the psets way easier"* 
> 2. *"Make sure you have some experience programming before taking the course."*
> 3. *’It’s a fair and interesting class; you’ll learn some useful things if you keep your mind open”*
