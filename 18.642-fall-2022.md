## Realistic Prerequisites
* In addition to the listed prerequisites (**18.03**, **18.06**, and **18.05/18.600**), some students think additional finance or probability knowledge may be useful.

## Subject Matter
* Students considered the class material somewhat theoretical while the projects were more applied. 

## Course Staff
* Professor Kempthorne was described as **very caring and approachable**, especially through office hours and email. 

## Lectures
* Lectures were thought to be difficult to follow due to the mathematical density of the content. 

## Problem Sets
* **Mixed Reviews**. Students generally seem to consider psets interesting and not too hard, while they could be a little long.
* Some students felt that lectures adequately prepared them for psets, while others did not feel prepared.

## Exams
* No exams. 

## Resources
* Lecture notes were made available. Students considered them to be thorough, but somewhat lacking in intuitive explanation.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **fair** and **very generous**. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"This is basically a CI-M!!! I didn't know this going into it, but I really wish I did
because it was not nearly as chill of a class to take as an elective, like I hoped."*
