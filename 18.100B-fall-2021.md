## Realistic Prerequisites
* **18.01** is a hard prerequisite. Knowing 18.02 was useful, but not required. 
* Some proof writing experience is recommended ahead of time as all psets are proof based.

## Subject Matter
* Very **theoretical** with more of a focus on topology than calculus. 
* Occasionally, applied examples were given.

## Course Staff
* The professor is very **approachable** after class and in office hours and was very engaging. 
* Many students praised the professors’ teaching style.

## Lectures
* Lectures were taught in an **active learning style**, where the professor would pause and allow for students to work through examples together. 
* Students primarily learned from the lectures, although some found them a bit too fast-paced.
* Lectures were necessary to learn the material as notes didn’t include proofs of theorems.

## Problem Sets
* Generally **not too difficult**.
* Students found that psets generally didn’t require much creativity.
* The grading of psets was strict.

## Exams
* The questions on midterms were **easier** than psets.
* A portion of each midterm would be recalling definitions.
* Students found professors’ suggestions on what to review helpful.

## Resources
* Although there was a textbook (*Elementary Analysis* by Thomson, Bruckner, and Bruckner), students **did not use it often** since lectures loosely followed the book.
* The professor provided lecture notes that summarized lemmas and theorems covered in class, but did not have proofs.


## Grading
* Students found the grading to be **transparent** and extremely fast.
* Grade cutoffs were released halfway through the semester.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Prof Seidel is great."* 
> 2. *"The class will depend a lot on the professor."*
> 3. *"Take this class before other advanced proof-writing classes."*
> 4. *”Make sure you ask for help if you don't understand something, because this is very much a class where results and concepts build off of each other, and if you don't understand one you could easily fall behind.”
