## Realistic Prerequisites
* **Necessary**: 18.01/18.02.
* **Helpful**: 18.06 for Markov chains, some exposure to proofs perhaps via 6.042, some basic probability/discrete math.

## Subject Matter
* Many thought the class was very applied, but some felt it was more abstract than expected.
* **Very foundational, broad, and useful**.
* The first few weeks were a review of basic probability. People with prior exposure found them slow, while others found them fast.

## Course Staff
* Students found the course staff **caring** and **understanding** (e.g. midterm was moved due to election).
* TAs were **helpful** and **responsive** on Piazza.

## Lectures
* Students found that the lectures were well-organized and engaging, contained helpful real-world examples, and connected to the psets.
* Students generally found the class **well-paced**; a few students found it slow.
* Lectures were asynchronous, supplemented by live problem-solving sessions.

## Problem Sets
* Students found the psets doable and fair, since the lectures adequately prepared them.
* Many students worked with others.
* Time spent on psets varied wildly. Some spent 3 hours, while others spent 12.

## Exams
* Students generally appreciated exam format and time given.
* Most students found exam difficulty **fair**. Some students found the exams challenging.

## Resources
* The lectures were self-contained. Lecture slides were made available.
* Most students **did not use the textbook.**
* There was a class Piazza, and it was good.

## Grading
* Professor gave cutoff approximations **after the second exam but prior to Drop Date.**
* Grading was **fair** and **transparent** (e.g. grade cutoffs for quizzes were given).

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. ***"Don't underestimate the class based on the first few weeks.** The class goes from 0-100. Don't get complacent."*
2. ***"Familiarity with writing proofs did come in handy and no guidance was provided in that respect**, so it helped to have taken 6.042 before. Reading a chunk of the optional textbook definitely helped lower the mental workload when covering that material."*
3. ***"Make sure you understand probability, you will see it everywhere."***
