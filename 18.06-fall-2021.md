## Realistic Prerequisites
* The content of **18.02** is a listed prerequisite, but most students felt they did not use it in this course. 
* Some students found taking **18.03** before this course was helpful. 

## Subject Matter
* This semester, many students thought it more theoretical than expected, but contained some application of the theories. 


## Course Staff
* **Very friendly**. TAs were very helpful, and quick to respond to emails. 
* Prof. Sun also made sure to thoroughly answer all questions in class. 

## Lectures
* Lectures and Psets were most helpful in the students' understanding. Some students found that the lectures did not have enough examples worked out in class. 
* **Lecture notes** helped students review material confusing in lectures. 

## Problem Sets
* **Moderately challenging.**
* Students spent between 3-5 hours on each problem set, but some spent more time on them later in the term. 
* Psets contained a fair mix of both theorems and computational problems.  
* Psets seemed to help students reinforce concepts from lectures. 

## Exams
* Many students felt the exams were **very difficult to finish in time**, as there were tedious hand calculations which took a majority of the time.
* Many students used the lecture notes and completed review problems to study for the exam. 

## Resources
* Course staff did not make a Piazza page, which made it difficult to ask questions while psetting. 
* Many students used Prof. Strang’s textbook, as Prof. Sun told students which sections to look at. 
* However, some students found this textbook confusing, and instead used Prof. Sun’s lecture notes, available on Canvas. 

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **unclear** and **strict**. It was not specified whether cutoffs given were for exams or the class overall. 
* Course staff did not announce final grade cutoffs, with a 90% not being enough for an A. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Watch Prof. Strang’s lectures for 18.06 on OCW"* 
> 2. *"Take this class. I really liked it."*
