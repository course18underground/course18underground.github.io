## Realistic Prerequisites
* The content of **6.1200 and 6.1210**, the current prerequisites, was a necessary prerequisite, but some people had equivalent prior proof/algorithm experience and knowledge. 
* The ability to write proofs was necessary. 
* Some knowledge of probability was helpful as well. 

## Subject Matter
* Students thought the class was quite theoretical, while covering applicable and useful concepts. 
* Most enjoyed the course content, which provided a broad overview and foundation for different types of algorithms and algorithm-related math concepts.

## Course Staff
* **Engaging professors and helpful TAs**. The professors had well-organized lecture presentations and the TAs were very helpful in answering questions. 

## Lectures
* The lectures were useful and well-taught, with well-organized lecture presentations, but sometimes mostly covered background information rather than the main topics.
*  The lectures and problem sets were most helpful, but exam reviews, recitations, and notes were also useful.

## Problem Sets
* **Fun and challenging.**
* Lectures as well as recitation materials were helpful for preparing for the problem sets. 
*The problem sets were fun and creative, and well-constructed and connected to the subject matter. 
* However, the problem sets were challenging, where the difficulty varied depending on the topic of the week. 
* Optional practice problems were additionally posted on Canvas.. 

## Exams
* The exams were considered relatively challenging. 
* The problems required some creativity. There was a high variance in exam difficulty between the two midterms and final. 

## Resources
* There was a textbook for reference, but not very often used relative to the lecture notes.
* The lecture notes were well-written, thorough, and wonderful. The recitation notes were also informative. The practice problems posted under the course resources were a good resource for studying as well.  

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **reasonably fair** and **transparent**. 
* The grading policy was flexible with two drops and three automatic extensions. 
Students thought the grading on problem sets was a bit unclear, but found exam grading to be fair. 
* Some students wished there had been clearer letter grade boundaries for the overall A/B/C/D/F grades. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Use all resources provided. A lot more time than you think is necessary for PSETs."* 
> 2. *"The lectures and professors are wonderful. The practice problems are useful and enjoyable.*
