## Realistic Prerequisites
* 18.100x is helpful for having proof-writing experience, and taking 18.701 helps with the group theory content. 

## Subject Matter
* Most thought the class was very theoretical, especially the first half, which was a lot of setup. 
* The second half of the class went more concretely into algebraic topology, which students enjoyed.

## Course Staff
* The professor was **very approachable** and made class enjoyable and interesting. Most thought the professor was a good lecturer and hosted good office hours.

## Lectures
* Most students said lectures were the main way they learned the content.

## Problem Sets
* Problems felt fair and appropriate to the content in lectures.
* Students reported they worked on problem sets alone.

## Exams
* Exams contained challenging problems, but not all were required to do well.
* All exams were open book/notes.

## Resources
* Most students relied on lecture notes which were released by the professor on Canvas.
* There was also a textbook, but not many students felt it was necessary to consult it.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was *mostly* fair, but slightly non-traditional, although lenient.
* It was sometimes easy to lose points because homework was graded out of such a small total.
* Grade cutoffs were not known in advance.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Try to attend lectures in the second half."*
