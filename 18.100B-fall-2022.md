## Realistic Prerequisites
* Familiarity with the content of **18.01** is strongly encouraged.
* Experience with proofreading is recommended, but not necessary.

## Subject Matter
* Most believe the content very theoretical, with some applications near the end of the semester. 
* Knowledge was foundational. 

## Course Staff
* **Approachable and knowledgeable.** The professor was very willing to help and encouraged students to use office hours and other resources.

## Lectures
* Students found the lectures mostly useful but sometimes disorganized. They were the main source of learning for most. 
* **Textbooks** helped clarify the lectures.

## Problem Sets
* Most students found the psets very fair and manageable. 
* Psets could usually be completed by reviewing lecture material. 

# Exams
* The exams were considered very reasonable and did not demand too much creativity.
* Open notes.

## Resources
* There were multiple textbooks, but none of them were particularly followed. TBB (Thomsom, Bruckner, and Bruckner) was particularly insightful.  
* There were no lecture notes, but there were lecture recordings.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was mostly fair and the policy was transparent.
* Some felt that grading was sometimes unclear. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Start early on the psets. It's hard to do the hardest problems under pressure."*
> 2. *"If you want to see whether pure math is for you or not, or you want to learn how to
write proofs, this class is what you should take."*
