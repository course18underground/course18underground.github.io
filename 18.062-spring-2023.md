## Realistic Prerequisites
* Most thought that 18.01 is a good prerequisite. 

## Subject Matter
* Most said that the class provided good foundational and theoretical knowledge. 

## Course Staff
* Most students said that the course staff was approachable and helpful. Course staff was also very responsive on Piazza. 

## Lectures
* Most students believed that they learned from solving psets rather than lectures - and that this prepared them more for the tests. Some students said the pace of the course varied through the semester. 
* **Textbooks** helped clarify the lectures.

## Problem Sets
* **Challenging.**
* Required time to think of applications of the concepts - OH and going to office hours usually helped to go through problems on the pset.
* Some students said the lecture material wasn’t directly related to psets.
* Most students said that the problem sets required creativity.

## Exams
* The exams were considered stressful and difficult. The problems were thought to be quite challenging, but many complained about the allotted time given the problems. 

## Resources
* Many referred to the textbook to clarify their understanding, which was available on Canvas.
* Lecture notes were very helpful to review concepts as well, also available on Canvas.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was ** transparent ** and **mostly reasonable**. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"I think attempting the psets and going to office horse for help would be beneficial."* 
> 2. *"Do the readings if you have time, they’re definitely helpful. Work with friends on PSETs and go to office hours earlier rather than later (they get crowded)"*
