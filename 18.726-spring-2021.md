## Realistic Prerequisites

- **18.725** was a hard pre-req.
- Knowledge of commutative algebra and differential geometry was useful.

## Subject Matter

- The content was **theoretical**, **broad**, and **foundational**.

## Course Staff

- The course staff was quite **approachable** and **helpful**.
- The professor was **enthusiastic** about the material.

## Lectures

- The lectures were **fast-paced** but **clear** and **useful** and gave intuition.
- Students also learned a lot from the textbook and the psets.

## Problem Sets

- **Challenging but not overwhelming**.
- They were **long** but there were no overly-grindy problems.

## Exams

- This class did not have exams in Spring 2021.

## Resources

- One textbook ([Vakil](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/FOAGnov1817public.pdf)).
- Also, there were lecture notes in the class. Towards the end, other sets of notes were referenced as well, but they were less useful than the textbook.

## Grading

- The grade was entirely based on psets.
- Students generally felt that grading was **fair** and **lenient**.
- The grade distribution/cutoffs were not given.

## Advice to Future Students

1. _"**Definitely go in prepared** (especially wrt soft prereqs), because algebraic geometry is tough. I'd suggest **reading the textbook in case anything doesn't make sense**, because it explains things very clearly._
2. _"Be prepared to **spend a lot of time working on psets**. Also pset with other people!"_
