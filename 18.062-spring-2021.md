## Realistic Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of **18.01** is essential, but otherwise there are no serious mathematical requirements.
- Knowledge of **LaTeX** is useful since problem sets were expected to be typed up in LaTex.

## Subject Matter

- Students felt that the course was **theoretical** and **proof-based**, but were somewhat applicable to computer science.
- Some students came out with more understanding and perspective of algorithms, while other students didn't gain much from the class.

## Course Staff

- Since the class was pre-recorded, the professors were not very involved and many students weren't aware that there were professors. However, they were helpful in terms of answering Piazza
- The TAs are **helpful**, **understanding**, and **knowledgable**, and are delighted to answer questions.

## Lectures

- The lectures were pre-recorded; some students found them **interesting** and **engaging** while others did not find them useful.
- The lecture content seemed to coincide with the material in the textbook and recitations.

## Problem Sets

- The problem sets were **challenging**; many students felt that the lectures were not sufficient for completing the problem sets. However, the textbook and recitation seem more helpful for the problem sets.
- Problems tended to be **fun, engaging**, require **creativity**, and provide connections to real-life.
- Working with others and going to office hours were very helpful for completing the problem sets.

## Exams

- There were **3 quizzes**, which were set up similarly to the problem sets.
- Students generally found the quizzes **stressful** and **challenging**.
- The course staff released "lots of practice" for the quizzes. Students found lectures, problem sets, recitation, and practice exams to be adequate preparation.

## Resources

- The primary resource was the free textbook [***Mathematics for Computer Science***].(https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/readings/MIT6_042JS15_textbook.pdf). Students generally found the textbook very helpful.
- Students also used notes posted by recitation leaders.

## Grading

- Students generally found the grading **transparent**.
- "For this semester at least, the grading cutoffs were set beforehand and clearly defined on the syllabus. They adjust exam scores upwards if the average falls below a certain point."
- "I like that the grading is split into a lot of different categories (so its not like one exam makes/breaks your entire grade). I also like that they provide a full breakdown of point distributions and stuff for psets/tests (after its due, however)"

## Advice to Future Students

> 1. _"This class seems very intimidating but you'll get through it! I had absolutely no experience with proofs or anything like that, and although the first few weeks and psets were a bit rough, the class definitely gets better!"_
> 2. _"Work with other people and start early enough so that there are still office hours between the time you start and the due date."_
> 3. _"Think about the problem sets on your own for a while before getting help! Definitely the best way to internalize the material"_
> 4. _"If youâ€™re not already familiar with induction, pay attention when they teach it at the beginning. Almost every pset, if not every pset, will require you to write an inductive proof."_
