## Subject Matter
* **Theoretical**, with some applications.
* Topics studied are **broad**, and are gone over **deeply**. 

## Course Staff
* The professor was **happy to answer questions** and **understanding**. Also, the professor was very **knowledgable about the course material**.

## Lectures
* The lectures were at a **good pace**, maybe slightly slow.
* A lot of **good examples**.

## Problem Sets
* Needed to do **5 problems from 15-20 problems given** in a problem set, 3 problem sets in total.
* **Fun problems requiring creativity**, and lectures were enough to complete.

## Exams
* No exams.

## Resources
* **Lecture notes** which were very good, some optional textbooks.

## Grading
* The grading was **lenient** and **fair**, with grades being **mostly A's**.
* Only needing to do 5 problems from each problem set to get A was **clear**.

## Advice to Future Students
 1. *"**Ask questions!** Prof. Postnikov frequently pauses and asks if things make sense or if anyone has questions. Typically many strong students will nod along and follow just fine, but Postnikov is aware there are students without that background and is very happy to go over any concepts."*
 2. *"Just **enjoy the material** and **ask lots of questions!**"*
