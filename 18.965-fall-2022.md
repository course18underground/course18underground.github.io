## Subject Matter
* Students described the subject matter as **theoretical** and **foundational**.

## Course Staff
* Professor Minicozzi and the course TA were **very approachable**.
* Office hours were very helpful.

## Lectures
* Students mentioned that lectures were **well-organized** and **clear**.
* Lectures for this class were a great resource in learning.

## Problem Sets
* The problem sets usually had high variance in difficulty and length, but were generally solvable in **groups** and **office hours**.
* A few students mentioned that problem sets were **computational** and relatively straightforward especially supplemented with office hours.

## Exams
* No exams!

## Resources
* **Textbook:** do Carmo's Riemannian Geometry.
* Several students also mentioned using a textbook that Minicozzi was currently writing.

## Grading
* Grading was described as mostly **lenient** and **fair**.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Attend lectures and discuss the class content with someone else."* 
> 2. *"This was a non-killer class that made me feel confident in differential geometry, so I would recommend."*
> 3. *”The material in this class is essential for anyone interested in Riemannian geometry. I highly recommend taking it, and thinking carefully through everything that is discussed in class.”*
