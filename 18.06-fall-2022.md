## Realistic Prerequisites
* The content of **18.01** and **18.02** was a necessary prerequisite. 
* Some students said programming experience was helpful. 

## Subject Matter

* Applications of course content are discussed in lecture as well.

## Course Staff
* **Mixed reviews**. 
* Some students felt very supported by course staff, as they were approachable and gave extensions.
* Others found their TAs were unwilling to spend time to help with problem sets.

## Lectures
* Students found the lectures fast and difficult to follow. 
* Students preferred recitation to lectures for understanding course content. 

## Problem Sets
* **Challenging.**
* Some students found the problems using Julia as especially hard, given their lack of coding experience.

* The review sessions before exams were especially helpful.
* Some students spent many hours studying to prepare.

## Resources
* Students used Prof. Johnson’s handwritten notes and Jupyter notebook.
* The textbook, *Introduction to Linear Algebra*, by Prof. Strang was helpful as well.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **incredibly transparent**, as Prof. Johnson gave cutoffs for each exam.
* Some students did not like that exams made up 75% of the overall course grade.
* The final was worth 40% of the overall grade.
