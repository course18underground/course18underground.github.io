## Realistic Prerequisites
* **18.100** was a **hard** prerequisite. 

## Subject Matter
* The content was a broad mix of **theoretical** and **applied**.
* There was a lot of intuition to be gained and there were many applications.

## Course Staff
* **Very approachable**. TAs were open and responsive.
* Some students felt the course staff could have left more comments on psets.

## Lectures
* Most students found the lectures **slow**, and not very helpful, but good for solidifying proofs.
* The textbook, lecture notes, and psets were more useful for learning the content

## Problem Sets
* Most students found the psets **straightforward**.
* Some problems were very **enjoyable and fun**, others were very **simple and unmotivated**.
* Students both worked together and by themselves.

## Exams
* Most students thought the exams were **doable** and not very difficult, and didn’t require lots of creativity.
* Some students wished more practice material was made available in advance.

## Resources
* **Textbook:** *Complex Analysis* by Stein and Shakarchi
* Lecture notes were also published, and followed the textbook closely.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **lenient** but **not transparent**. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Read the textbook."* 
> 2. *"Go back through lectures with another student and talk out all the proofs and theorems."*
> 3. *”Good class, maybe a bit too slow on the lectures.”*
