## Realistic Prerequisites
* Knowledge of proof-writing and abstract reasoning is a must. **18.100x** is a soft prerequisite, and some experience with group theory in *18.700/18.701* is helpful but not necessary. 

## Subject Matter
* The subject matter is very **theoretical**, with the first half of the class covering point-set topology, generalizing some notions from real analysis. Over the second half, algebraic topology is introduced to prepare students for taking higher-level topology courses, such as 18.905: Algebraic Topology I.

## Course Staff
* **Supportive and well-prepared.** The professor is very kind and approachable. The professor was happy to answer questions after class and was responsive over email.

## Lectures
* Students found lectures helpful in introducing new concepts, but **fast-paced**. 
* Reading **lecture notes** helped answer questions, and **problem sets** helped solidify students’ understanding. 

## Problem Sets
* Problem sets were **long**.
* Some students found the problem sets to be very instructive and useful in understanding the material. 
* Others felt that the problems were repetitive and uninspiring, especially with definition questions on point-set topology near the beginning of the course. 
* Collaboration and office hours were helpful.

## Exams
* The exams were fair and straightforward applications of the material. Students found that lectures and psets prepared them well.
* The professor was transparent about what questions to expect (one problem from lecture, one from a pset, and one new). However, some students found this to encourage memorization.

## Resources
* The professor posted comprehensive typed lecture notes. Students found them extremely useful and the main resource to reference.
* The class followed Munkres’ *Topology; a first course* for point-set topology and the first part of Hatcher’s *Algebraic topology* for the algebraic topology half.
*Office hours were helpful.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **fair** and **reasonable**. Cutoffs were stricter than expected (90=A, 80=B, etc. with no +/- qualifiers), and were announced before the drop date.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"I highly recommend taking this course!! It is super fun and very interesting."*
> 2. *"Work through as many examples as possible!"*
