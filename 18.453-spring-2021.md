## Realistic Prerequisites

-   Students recommend having some familiarity with **algorithms** (e.g. 6.006, 6.046) and proof-based **discrete math** (e.g. 18.200).
-   Basic knowledge of linear algebra, graph theory, and big-O notation/runtimes is very helpful.

## Subject Matter

-   **Foundational and mostly theoretical** but with many useful applications, some of which are pointed out on psets.
-   Students found the course content **somewhat broad** but still able to be tied together.

## Course Staff

-   Students found the instructor and TA to be **very approachable, accommodating, and considerate**.
-   _"Cole is a very caring instructor and will happily make time to help you - he is very accessible. And the TA (Alexey) was great too!"_

## Lectures

-   Most students found the lectures to be **very useful for understanding the course material** and seeing illustrative examples.
-   Pacing was **sometimes too fast**, especially for more difficult proofs.
-   _"Lectures are good - Cole is always willing to slow down and go back over something to make sure that everyone is understanding the material. Don't be afraid to ask questions during the lectures!"_

## Problem Sets

-   Students found the biweekly problem sets to be **fun and doable** and felt well-prepared by the lectures.

## Exams

-   Most students found the exams to be **not too stressful** and generally easier than the psets.
-   Reviewing lecture notes and taking practice quizzes was helpful.
-   There was **adequate time** for the exams.

## Resources

-   There is a set of thorough typed notes written by Prof. Goemans from a previous semester. These are accompanied by handwritten notes presented during class.
-   Students found both sets of notes **very helpful**.

## Grading

-   Grading was **fair and transparent**, with comments on Gradescope and posted solutions.
-   Some students felt the midterm (25%) and final (35%) were too heavily weighted.

## Advice to Future Students

> 1. _"I really loved the content of the course. Definitely take it if you know that you like combinatorics."_
> 2. _"Please make generous use of the office hours, not just for pset help but to explore anything else you might be wondering about as well. Combinatorial optimization is such a rich topic, and you definitely want to make sure you get the most out of the class!"_
