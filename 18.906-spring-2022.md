## Realistic Prerequisites
* The content of **18.601, 18.101** and **18.905** were seen as necessary prerequisites. 
* Students said knowing some algebraic geometry would be helpful, but not required.

## Subject Matter
* Some students thought that the subject was very broad, and pure.

## Course Staff
* The TA was **very helpful and approachable**. 
* Students wrote that Prof. Seidel was helpful, but was sometimes too vague when responding to questions in office hours.

## Lectures
* The lectures were seen as fast and disorganized. Students said it took multiple parsing of lecture notes in order to grasp the material sufficiently.

## Problem Sets
* Students found the problem sets challenging, yet enjoyable. 
* Some students parsed the lecture notes multiple times to help them complete the assignment.

## Exams
* There were no exams for this course.

## Resources
* Many referred to Haynes Miller’s handwritten notes, which Prof. Seidel referred students to at the start of every lecture.
* Some used Prof. Hatcher’s textbook to supplement these.

## Grading
* Students said that cutoffs were not always transparent. 
* Cutoff for an A previously was between 80 and 85%.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Go to office hours! The psets will be much less painful"* 
> 2. *"I would highly recommend this course with this professor!"*
