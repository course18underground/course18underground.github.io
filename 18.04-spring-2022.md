## Realistic Prerequisites
* The content of **18.01** and **18.02** was a necessary prerequisite. **18.03** was useful but most thought it was not essential. 

## Subject Matter
* Most thought it was very applied and broadly useful for other subjects.

## Course Staff
* Students found the professor (Peter Baddoo) and the TA to be approachable and communicative.

## Lectures
* Students had mixed feedback on whether lectures or psets helped them learn more. Lectures were well paced.
* **Course notes, office hours** helped clarify the lectures.

## Problem Sets
* **Time Consuming.**
* Most students thought the psets were very lengthy, but straightforward.
* Lectures are generally helpful for the psets.
* While long, psets were often fun and helped with course material.

## Exams
* Students felt the exams were challenging. Many mentioned not having enough time to finish the exam, or that the difficulty of the exam mostly came from the time pressure. Reviewing lectures and pset solutions helped.

## Resources
* Lecture notes were available on Canvas, and were generally considered helpful. 
* Many found online lecture notes by a previous professor, Jeremy Orloff, to be extremely helpful.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **not transparent**.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Make sure to pay attention in classes, work with others, and start the psets early"*
