## Realistic Prerequisites
* The content of **18.01** is a hard prerequisite. 
* Experience with vector operations and set notation was helpful.

## Subject Matter
* Lectures were more **theoretical** with an emphasis on **proofs**, while PSET and test questions were **computational** and rarely had proofs.

## Course Staff
* Both Professor Borodin and the TA were described as **caring** and helpful, and willing to put in the time to help students.
* Students were encouraged to ask questions during class.
* **Flexible and understanding**, especially in regards to accommodations and schedules.

## Lectures
* Students agreed that Professor Borodin was a fantastic lecturer.
* Lectures were entertaining, **engaging**, and **well-paced**. They were good for a theoretical overview of the topic, and questions that "consistently challenge assumptions of mathematics."
* **Textbook** (*Vector Calculus* by Susan Colley) closely followed lectures and helped clarify explanations.
* Office hours and PSETS helped reinforce what was learned in lecture and developed application skills.


## Problem Sets
* PSETS always consisted of **textbook problems**.
* Students typically spent 2-3 hours a week on psets.
* Most students agreed the problem sets were mostly **computational or routine** applications of course material. They were not perceived as very fun, challenging, or creative, but instead described as tedious, repetitive, or boring.
* Lectures prepared students for psets.


## Exams
* Students described the exams as **standard, straightforward, and fair.** 
* Studying materials such as practice problems were provided.
* Lectures prepared students for the exams.
* **Practice problems** and OCW materials are useful in preparing for exams. 
* Difficulty of exams varied highly. Students agreed the second exam covered more complicated material and was more of a time crunch. Grade cutoffs were lowered to account for this.


## Resources
* Susan Jane Colley's *Vector Calculus (4th ed.)* was used in the class, and was helpful and provided clear explanations. 
* Professor McKernan's 2010 lecture notes were also provided but did not always align with what was covered in class. 


## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **fair** and **transparent**.
* Students mentioned that there was no credit for late work, and regrades were not openly offered.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *“Spend time thinking about the material outside of class or you will become lost easily”*
> 2. *“I would recommend taking this instead of 18.02 if you enjoy seeing proofs in lecture.”*
