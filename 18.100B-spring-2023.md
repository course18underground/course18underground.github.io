## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Don't take the class if you don't know how to write proofs. Go to lecture because if you miss something, it's going to be hard to understand the next material."* 
> 2. *"I think a key piece of advice is to use the textbook, since I think it is a very good way to supplement the lectures. In a pinch it can also be used to catch up if you miss a lecture or two."*
