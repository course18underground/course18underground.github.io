## Realistic Prerequisites
* The content of **18.03** was a necessary prerequisite. 

## Course Staff
* **There are no TAs**. The professor was very willing to help as needed.

## Lectures
* The lectures were challenging and prepared students for the problem sets.

## Problem Sets
* **Reasonable, relative to lectures.**
* Over the semester, there were only 5 problem sets with ample time for each.
* Challenging lectures prepared students for the problem sets.

## Exams
* The midterm was somewhat challenging, and some students were unable to finish on time.

## Resources
* The textbook was Suli & Mayers, An Introduction to Numerical Analysis.
* Typed lecture notes written by the instructor were very helpful.

## Grading
* The grading was 50% problem sets with the lowest problem set dropped, 20% midterm, and 30% final.
