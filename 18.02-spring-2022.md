## Realistic Prerequisites
* The content of **18.01** was a necessary prerequisite. 

## Subject Matter
* Most thought it was a good balance between theoretical and applications of the theories. 
* Some students recommended taking 8.02 at the same time to help understand the material on flux. 

## Course Staff
* Students found TAs **helpful and approachable**, especially since they did review sessions before exams. 
* Some students said the professor (Prof. Staffilani) was not approachable and was not lenient with extensions.

## Lectures
* Most students believed they learned from the lecture notes and not the lectures. 
* Students went to office hours and did practice problems to reinforce learning. 


## Problem Sets
* Problem sets contained an online pset and a written pset submission. 
* Students found lectures did not prepare them well for psets.
* Students found **working in groups** helped them work through the psets. 
* Students spent 5 or more hours on each pset.

## Exams
* Students found the exams straight-forward, but tough to complete in the allotted time. 
* Practice problems were how most students prepared for the exams. 

## Resources
* Most students used the lecture notes extensively.
* Some referred to the course textbook to clarify their understanding.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **transparent** but **harsh**.
* 75% of the grade came from midterms and the final exam. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Doing lots of practice problems is really important"* 
> 2. *"Work on psets early. Very early, with others, even if you need to bother people, do it!"*
> 3. *”Do the readings and read the lecture notes, even if you already attended lecture.“*
