## Realistic Prerequisites

- Consider **18.600** (or a substitute like 6.041) a **hard prerequisite**.
- Students should be very comfortable with material from **18.02**.
- Some students found linear algebra experience from **18.06** and knowledge of convergence from **18.100** helpful.

## Subject Matter

- Mostly **theoretical**, but provides some real-world **applications**.
- Fundamentals of statistics are covered thoroughly.
- Students learn to "confidently set up a statistical model for a given problem and derive useful statistical tools like estimators, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing."
- Some felt that the mock datasets felt a bit meaningless. Some also felt that results could have been proved more thoroughly.

## Course Staff

- **Caring, engaging, and invested in the students' learning.**
- Prof. Maunu is very understanding, and was **very active in answering questions on Piazza**.
- Office hours, recitations, and review sessions were very good.
- **Jonathan was especially helpful**, consistent, and patient when explaining concepts to students, even staying late after office hours.

## Lectures

- Lectures were **engaging**, but **a bit slow**.
- Prof. Maunu works through **guiding examples** during the lecture, which students found helpful.
- At times, there was not enough time in the lecture for Prof. Maunu to finish teaching the material or give enough guiding motivation for results.

## Problem Sets

- There was a problem set due every two weeks.
- The problem sets were fairly **challenging**, but **followed the lectures** closely.
- Students found them important for mastering the course material.
- Problem sets were **somewhat lengthy**, taking some students up to 10 hours, but others about 6-8 hours.
- Some students found later problem sets, which contained more calculations, tedious.

## Exams

- Difficulty was **reasonable**. Problems required **little creativity** and closely matched material covered in problem sets.
- Exams were **open book** and **open notes**.
- Due to the **12 hour time limit**, exams were **not stressful**. However, they were designed to take 90 minutes to complete.
- Some students found it easy to make silly computation mistakes and lose points for them.

## Resources

- There was **no textbook**. While the professor recommended an optional, supplemental textbook, students **sorely missed** having an official textbook.
- The main resource was **lecture slides** annotated by Prof. Maunu, which students often found **inadequate**.

## Grading

- **Very lenient and fair**.
- Students performed quite well on exams. Many grades were in the 80s and 90s.
- Partial credit can sometimes be hard to predict, and cutoffs were not very transparent.

## Advice to Future Students

> 1. Take the probability prereqs for this class or study up beforehand, go to office hours, find some PSet buddies.
> 2. Have a good understanding of probability.
> 3. If you wanted to take this class because statistics is the foundation of machine learning, I think you'll also need to take some more class beyond this one. This class is a reasonable intro that would probably help with more advanced classes though.
