## Realistic Prerequisites
* Experience with **proof-writing** is a must.
* Familiarity with big-O notation and algorithms helped, but wasn’t necessary.

## Subject Matter
* Almost all students agreed that this class is very **theoretical**.
* The material covered was **broad and foundational**, mainly in complexity theory.

## Course Staff
* **Approachable and kind**, but many students complained that there were not enough TAs.
* The TAs who were hired put in extra work so that everyone who wanted to meet with them could, though.

## Lectures
* Most students believed that they learned the most from lectures, but found all resources helpful.
* Many mentioned that the professor was a **very engaging** presenter.
* The pacing was **just right**.

## Problem Sets
* **Difficult**, but full of interesting problems.
* Problems required lots of time, and many went to OH for help.
* Overall, problems were more on the **theoretical** side.
* Students took between **4-10 hours per pset**, but psets were only assigned every other week.

## Exams
* The one midterm was somewhat difficult and had some time pressure, but most felt the exam was fair.
* The exam was **open book**, but required attention to detail.
* Most of the content came from the lectures.

## Resources
* Almost all students referred to the textbook which the professor wrote, *Theory of Computation* by Michael Sipser, and it was available online.
* Some students mentioned that the textbook alone was enough to do well.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **incredibly fair** and **reasonable**.
* The late policy for psets was flexible as well. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *”Do the psets early."* 
> 2. *"Take this class!"*
> 3. *”Go to Office Hours!!”*
> 4. *”Take this class if you like CS, otherwise I do not recommend it.”*
> 5. *”Prepare for exams.”*
