## Realistic Prerequisites
* The content of **18.01** was a necessary prerequisite. 
* Some recommended learning some basics of linear algebra before this course, but this is unnecessary.

## Subject Matter
* Students described 18.02 as **foundational** and **applied**. 
* Some disliked the inclusion of linear algebra in the course content.

## Course Staff
* TAs were very helpful and thoroughly explained concepts or questions students had. 
* Students expressed discomfort in asking the professor questions.

## Lectures
* Most students believed that they learned from solving psets and going to lectures or reading the lecture notes. 
* Some students found the lectures to be fast-paced, but would look at notes before or after class to understand the material better.
* A few students also mentioned office hours being helpful for asking questions.

## Problem Sets
* Students found the psets of mixed difficulty.
* Students felt the problems required some creative thinking and were easier when collaborating with others. 
* Students spent 3-5 hours a week on the psets. 

## Exams
* The exams were of mixed difficulty, as one was described as a time crunch, and another described as easier.
* Students felt the lectures and practice exams prepared them for each exam. 

## Resources
* Many used the lecture notes and lecture recordings. 
* Prof. Hahn referred students to another classmate’s unofficial notes about halfway through the course.
* There was not a course textbook.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **fair**. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Attend lecture! Even if you've taken a high school multi class, chances are there's
something in here that you haven't learned before, or a better/different way to think about a problem, even if it just comes down to notation."* 
> 2. *"Put in the extra work (recitation, listening in lecture) to understand why the theorems
and equations work, and memorize all the equations."*
