## Realistic Prerequisites
* Prior knowledge of topology, differential geometry, and multivariable calculus were all very helpful.
* Even without these softer prerequisites, it was possible to succeed with interest and willingness to learn the material.

## Subject Matter
* Students agreed the material was **theoretical and deep**.

## Course Staff
* The consensus was that the course staff were **very understanding and helpful**.

## Problem Sets
* Students found the PSets **appropriately challenging**, but also **interesting** and **creative**.

## Exams
* There were no exams.

## Resources
* The course used the textbook *A Course in Minimal Surfaces* by Colding and Minicozzi.
* Many felt the textbook was not very clear, but did help sometimes.

## Grading
* Students thought grading was **fair** and reported most students expected As. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Very important to stay caught up at the very beginning of the semester."* 
> 2. *"This class is a lot of work, only take if you are comfortable with geometry or if you are
willing to put in extra time to learn the material."*
> 3. *”This was a really enjoyable course! I highly recommend taking it for your CI-M requirement if you have any interest in geometry.”*
