## Realistic Prerequisites
* The content of **18.100x** was a necessary prerequisite. Other than that, students found knowledge of probability concepts through **18.600** or an equivalent useful. 

## Subject Matter
* Students found the subject to be very **theoretical**. 
* The first half of the class was focused on Measure Theory, with the second half more focused on probability theory.

## Course Staff
* Students found the course staff **helpful**, especially when attending office hours.  

## Lectures
* Most students felt that they learned most from the professor’s posted lecture notes, as well as the assigned problem sets. 

## Problem Sets
* **Challenging and time-consuming.**
* Problem sets were assigned biweekly, but students found them incredibly time-intensive and challenging.
* Four problem sets were assigned in total, with two additional take-home exams. 
* Collaboration on psets was absolutely necessary. 
* The professor helped outline steps on problems when necessary. 

## Exams
* Both the midterm and final were take-home and closed-note.
* Some students found the exams quite stressful, while others found them interesting and fair. 

## Resources
* The instructor posted very thorough lecture notes, which the students found useful as a reference.
* The course referenced the book *Probability: Theory and Examples* by Rick Durrett.
 
## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **harsh**, yet **fair**.
* Grading was **not transparent** with little information on the grading rubric. Cutoffs were not released until late in the semester, with an A being around 85%. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"This class requires a lot of dedication but I did learn a lot."* 
> 2. *"Take the class with friends, and don't do the psets alone."*
