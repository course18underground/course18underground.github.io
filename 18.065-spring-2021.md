## Realistic Prerequisites

- Taking **18.06** or having some experience with linear algebra is helpful.
- **Some familiarity with scientific computing languages** like Python, MATLAB, or Julia can also be helpful.

## Subject Matter

- A **mixture of both theoretical and applied** material in the problem sets.
- The final project and Prof. Strang's various explanations of real world uses of linear algebra, such as deep learning, create a solid base
  of applied knowledge for use in engineering.

## Course Staff

- Prof. Strang is **very approachable**. He cares a lot about the students' learning, and his **love of teaching linear algebra** is infectious.
- The course staff is very helpful and approachable as well. Though they had **some disorganization issues with the online format** at first, such as being unresponsive on Piazza, the staff **became more organized and helpful** over time.

## Lectures

- When lecturing, Prof. Strang uses **many examples** and works through hard concepts by thinking them through with the students. He frequently makes connections between different topics by way of figures and examples.
- The pace of the lectures is **easy-going** and the explanations are **clear**.
- The lectures are **taught from the pre-typed Zoom notes**, which make them **less engaging** and **harder to follow**, since little advantage is taken of the online setting (such as polls or chat discussion) and copying things like pre-typed example matrices is inconvenient. These problems will likely be mitigated by in-person lecturing.

## Problem Sets

- There are four problem sets, one every two weeks, and then a final project.
- The problems sets are **fun and not very challenging**.
- The lectures prepare students well for the problem sets, which make new connections between bits of material covered in lecture. Some find this **illuminating and creative**, but some find this **unintuitive and challenging**, in particular, in the deep learning section.

## Exams

- There are **no exams**!

## Resources

- A set of Prof. Strang's "Zoom notes", from which he teaches lectures.
  - There is also a textbook from Prof. Strang that you can request from him.

## Grading

- The grading policy is **lenient, but vague**.
- While some students feel nervous about whether they might get a B, many students feel they could focus on the material without stressing about their grade.

## Advice to Future Students

> 1. _"Please just focus on Prof. Strang's lectures!! He is a pure legend when it comes to Linear Algebra!!"_
> 2. _"Work with others on the p-sets!_
> 3. _"Insist on Piazza questions getting answered."_
