## Realistic Prerequisites

- **18.02 strongly recommended.**
- **Prior proof writing experience also recommended.**

## Subject Matter

- **Theoretical** with a few applied examples. Essential foundation for upper level math.
- Students generally found the material interesting. Some students felt the material was presented too quickly.

## Course Staff

- **Overwhelmingly positive.** Students found the professor approachable, engaging, and caring.
- "The professor is very helpful and emailed me personally to talk over the midterm. I appreciated her taking the time to talk with me, and I was not made to feel bad about my midterm grade, the meeting was purely to help my learning."
- "All professors and TAs went above and beyond to help me. They are the most caring, approachable and kind people. I cannot speak more highly of them."

## Lectures

- The lectures recieved **mixed reviews**. Some students felt that the lectures were too fast and assumed too much proof writing background, while others found the pace good.
- Lectures were typically a repeat of proofs from the book.

## Problem Sets

- Assigned **weekly.**
- **Challenging but not too challenging**.
- The lectures prepared students for the problem sets. The problem sets were similar to problems covered in lecture.
- Prepared students well for the midterm.

## Exams

- **One 24-hour take-home midterm**, worth 25% of the grade. The average was in the 60s.
- **Final exam** was stressful, worth 25% of the grade.
- Students found the exams difficult. Some felt that more exam practice could've been given.

## Resources

- The course used a **free online textbook** (Lebl - _Basic Analysis: Introduction to Real Analysis (Vol. 1)_), which students found very helpful.
- Lecture notes were also available.

## Grading

- Grading was **fair and transparent**. Grading was lenient on the problem sets and tough on the exams.
- "I am not too clear on the expected grade distribution, but I think the professor did say anything above an 85 - 90 is an A."
