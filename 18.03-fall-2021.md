## Realistic Prerequisites
* **18.01** knowledge is absolutely necessary.
* **18.02** was helpful but not strictly required.
* 18.06/linear algebra knowledge was not required but was useful.

## Subject Matter
* Useful in multiple fields and foundational.
* Students found a nice mix of theoretical and applied content, but the theory was messier compared to the applications.
* Examples across multiple disciplines and modeling of systems were provided in lecture.

## Course Staff
* The staff offered relevant exam preparation sessions.
* The staff were helpful and approachable to most respondents.
* Course staff seemed empathetic to student struggles and needs (e.g. extensions).
* The staff answered emails promptly.

## Lectures
* The lectures provided “background/overview,” but many students found recitation (in conjunction with MITx) to be the most useful.
* Students found office hours useful in supplementing tools learned in class.
* Some found the lectures to be concise and palatable.

## Problem Sets
* Collaboration was encouraged, and some found it useful to work in groups.
* Some found it necessary to utilize MITx, office hours, and/or recitation to figure out the problems.
* Students who found psets straightforward still commented on psets being “bashy” with “messy” numbers or algebra involved.

## Exams
* Students found that the exams got progressively more difficult as the semester progressed.
* **Practice exams and review sessions** were important resources.
* Students found the **time pressure** of exams to be stressful, especially factoring in the computations involved.

## Resources
* Most students found **MITx** to be a very useful resource.
* Some felt that they learned most of the course through the readings and videos on MITx.
* The lecture slides on Canvas were “extremely clear and a great study tool.”

## Grading
* Students found the grading transparent and very **fair**.
* 55+ was passing, 70+ was a B, and 85+ was an A this semester.
* There was a sentiment that poor exam performance was a reflection of improper preparation and not the students.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. * Respondents stressed that students should put effort into finding a **good recitation leader**, attend recitation regularly, and attend office hours as well.
> 2. * Some found that understanding applications helped to solidify understanding.
> 3. * Students should attend lectures and stay up-to-date on the material, or the class could become too challenging.
> 4. * For exams, the provided practice tests and notes should be reviewed seriously.
