## Realistic Prerequisites

- **Proofs:** there were a lot of proofs in the class, and having experience with proofs is useful.
- **Single variable Calculus is important** (multivariable calculus did not appear often).

## Subject Matter

- **Theoretical, abstract**. Went over proofs from single variable Calculus. However, many examples were given.
- **Foundation** given for future math classes.

## Course Staff

- The professor was very **attentive** as well as **approchable**, and actively answered questions from students.

## Lectures

- Lectures were **well prepared** and **clear**, covering the material in an **organized** way.
- Previous experience with proofs make the lectures easier to follow.

## Problem Sets

- **Difficult** and required students to use theorems **creatively**. However, problems are **doable** over time.
- Often, psets are applications of theorems from lectures.

## Exams

- The problems on the exams were **similarly difficult, maybe slightly easier than the psets**.
- The exams was **closed notes** and **challenging**, requiring **creativity**.
- The **practice exams and lectures** were very useful for preparing.

## Resources

- Two textbooks ([Rudin](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Mathematical-Analysis-International-Mathematics/dp/007054235X) and [TBB](https://www.amazon.com/Elementary-Real-Analysis-Second/dp/1434841618)).
- But, the lecture notes were **used more**.

## Grading

- Overall, the students found the grading to be **fair** and **transparent**.
- Expected that many got As and Bs.

## Advice to Future Students

1. _"The class can be **pretty challenging** but is **very fun and rewarding**! While many students in the class will probably already know how to write proofs and do not struggle much with the material, **a big point of the class is help students develop their proof writing skills**, so don't feel bad if you struggle at first!"_
2. _"I think it is important to **stay on track with lectures** and **spend time working through problem sets** and trying out the proofs before working with other people."_
