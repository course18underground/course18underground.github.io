## Realistic Prerequisites

- **18.702** and **18.112** are useful, and knowledge of Galois theory is essential.
- Programming experience is a must.
- Some algebraic number theory and topology are also helpful.

## Subject Matter

- This class can be considered **theoretical, applied, useful, deep, and broad** all at the same time.
- The beginning was more algorithmic in focus, but the second half of the course was more focused on theory.

## Course Staff

- The professor is **friendly**, **approachable**, **helpful**, and **caring**.

## Lectures

- The lectures were rather **fast-paced** and sometimes skipped proofs, although all the details could be found in the lecture notes.

## Problem Sets

- **Challenging, fun, and required creativity.**
- They are fairly long, and often required both coding as well as math.
- They had a choose-your-own adventure structure: students got to choose 3-5 problems to solve.

## Exams

- This course did not have exams this semester.

## Resources

- There are thorough lecture notes on the professor's website, which are **detailed** and **helpful** and **sufficient**.
- There are listed textbooks, but they are mostly supplemental and not necessary.

## Grading

- Grading is pretty **fair** and **transparent**.
- There is a **fixed cutoff** and students expect that most get As.
- There are many in-class extra credit opportunities available.

## Advice to Future Students

> 1. _"I was pretty intimidated by the first lecture and problem set, but sticking with the class
>    proved to be very rewarding. The problem sets are hard (at least for me with my 18.702 background),
>    and sure enough, they get harder as the semester progresses, but they're also very stimulating and it's
>    rewarding to collaborate with others when possible."_
> 2. _"\*\*The class might feel like it's rushing by you at times, but working hard on the pset
>    problems and going to office hours really helps click things together! Also don't worry if you don't get
>    everything; the course is designed for you to choose some parts to learn well and some parts to softly
>    ignore."_
