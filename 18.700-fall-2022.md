## Realistic Prerequisites
* Experience with mathematical proofs was helpful but not required. Some students also appreciated previous exposure to linear algebra. 

## Subject Matter
* The subject matter was very theoretical. 

## Course Staff
* Students found the course staff **caring** and **helpful**. 
* Some students didn’t find the lecturer very engaging. 

## Lectures
* Most students learned most from completing the problem sets and reading the textbook. 
* Lectures mostly focused on introducing and proving theorems found in the textbook. 

## Problem Sets
* Many students found the problem sets **difficult**, but doable using content learned in the lecture.
* Problem sets required a higher level of mathematical maturity, and collaboration was helpful. 

## Exams
* **Stressful and challenging.** 
* The exams were considered difficult to finish on time but not totally unreasonable. 
* Students found that the lectures and problem sets did not prepare them enough. 

## Resources
* Most students found the textbook *Linear Algebra Done Right* by Sheldon Axler to be incredibly helpful. 
* Recorded lectures were also available online. 

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **not transparent**.
* Students with less proof experience found the grading to be harsher. 
* Midterms were worth 40%, the final was 30%, and problem sets were 30% of the grade.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"This is a cool class for anyone interested in the "why" of math!"* 
> 2. *"Be ready to dedicate time to this subject if you want a good grade."*
