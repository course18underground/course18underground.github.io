## Realistic Prerequisites
* Students recommend 18.06 for familiarity with adjacency matrices and Markov matrices.

## Subject Matter
* Most thought it was very applied. 
* Students thought the content was largely useful, and all interesting.

## Course Staff
* The instructor (Dr. Weigandt) was **super approachable** and great to talk to about the course.
* There were many office hours by both Dr. Weigandt and the Undergraduate Assistant.

## Lectures
* Students learned equally from the lectures, the textbook, and the psets.
* Concept questions in class helped students check their learning with the material.

## Problem Sets
* Students found the psets fun but challenging. 
* The professor prepared students well for the psets.
* Psets took anywhere from 5 to 8 hours.

## Exams
* Students found the exams challenging.
* The 2nd exam, out of 3, was notably the most challenging.
* Students prepared for the exams by going through practice problems.

## Resources
* Students used the textbook (A Walk Through Combinatorics by Miklos Bona), lecture notes, and class recordings. 

## Grading
* Grading was described as fair.
* Dr. Weigandt published that cutoffs would not be higher than 90/80/70 for an A/B/C.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Take this class with Dr. Weigandt, she's great."* 
> 2. *"Practice problems, practice problems, practice problems!"*
