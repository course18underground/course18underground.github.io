## Realistic Prerequisites
* Linear algebra and complex numbers are necessary.
* Previous experience with quantum mechanics in a class such as **8.04** is not necessary, but some students considered it very helpful.
* Previous experience with algorithms or theoretical CS may be helpful.

## Subject Matter
* Students thought the class provided a **broad and theoretical** take on quantum computing.
* Some also thought it improved their understanding of applied linear algebra and quantum mechanics. 

## Course Staff
* Both the professor and the TA were described as **approachable** and **helpful**.
* Staff were easily available through Piazza and OH.

## Lectures
* Students said they learned the most from lecture notes, psets, and other outside sources.
* Reviews of lectures were mixed - while some said they contained useful examples, several students claimed lectures were disorganized and hard to follow.

## Problem Sets
* Most considered psets **challenging**, requiring significant time and creativity.
* Some thought they were more **computational** than PSets in other courses.
* Students generally thought psets were **fun** and **helpful** despite the high effort required.

## Exams
* Most students thought exams were difficult but not unreasonable.
* The practice exams were considered very useful to prepare.

## Resources
* Most students used the class lecture notes as their primary resource and considered them to be helpful.
* Many considered the class textbook, *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Nielsen and Chuang, to be a useful supplement.

## Grading
* Students seem to feel that grading was **fair** overall. 

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *“Be prepared to take extra time to read other resources and head to OH.”* 
> 2. *“If you want to understand quantum computers - take this class. If you want an easy A -
don’t.”*
> 3. *“Don’t take this course unless you have a solid background in theoretical cs/information
theory.”*
