## Realistic Prerequisites
* **Mathematical maturity**: some prior proof-writing experience (perhaps via the IAP proofs workshop or another course with a focus on proof-writing) is *highly recommended*, as the learning curve is quite steep.
* **Knowledge of calculus in a single variable is essential** (perhaps also calculus in several variables, but this is more of a soft prereq).

## Subject Matter
* **Theoretical, broad and deep, abstract**. Could have been even more abstract, though -- tended to focus mainly on the real line rather than higher-dimensional reals or a more general metric space.
* **The skills gained** (i.e. formulating proofs with a high level of rigor) **might be more important than much of the subject matter itself**.

## Course Staff
* **Approachable**, very open to questions, and **accommodating** of extenuating circumstances.
* Both the professor and the TAs were caring and helpful.

## Lectures
* Many students **learned the most from the problem sets and from the TA’s office hours**, rather than from lectures.
* Students tended to use the textbook as a **secondary resource** when confused about parts of lectures.
* Lectures were engaging and had good examples; the professor addressed all student questions.

## Problem Sets
* **Challenging, but generally doable.**
* Problems tended to be straightforward rather than requiring creativity.
* Lectures generally prepared students well for the psets.

## Exams
* Many students found timing to be an issue.
* The problems were **on par with the psets difficulty-wise**.
* **Solving psets and knowing critical facts from lecture was helpful**.
* Many students found the exams **stressful** and **discouraging**, primarily due to a mismatch of difficulty level with time allotted.

## Resources
* Two textbooks ([Rudin](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Mathematical-Analysis-International-Mathematics/dp/007054235X) and [TBB](https://www.amazon.com/Elementary-Real-Analysis-Second/dp/1434841618)); it was nice to have two perspectives on the material.
* Some students found **Rudin to be much more useful than class**.
* It would’ve been nice to have lecture notes posted.

## Grading
* Grade cutoffs were **not publicized**.
* Students generally felt that grading was **fair** and **consistent**.
* "The professor seems to expect most people to get Bs and As."

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"I think it’s better for them to **practice proof-writing before taking this class**, or **at least have an idea of how to write rigorous proofs**. Also, they should ask themselves, 'Do I really want to learn how real numbers are constructed, and calculus is formed?'' If yes, then they should take the class."*
 2. *"**It is very rigorous!** It can be a bit annoying, but it is a necessary challenge."*
