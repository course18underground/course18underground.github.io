## Realistic Prerequisites
* **18.600** was necessary and sufficient.

## Subject Matter
* **Some students found the class very theoretical, while others found it very applied.** The course appealed to both theoretical and applied math students.
* The material was theoretical, with examples drawn from applications.
* "The content was what you wanted it to be."

## Course Staff
* The professor was **very friendly, approachable, and considerate.** Students universally found that he cared a lot about them.
* "Accomodating with things like switching presentation times."
* "I cannot think of a single time this entire semester when he denied me an extension."
* "I also really enjoyed the guest speakers he brought in."

## Lectures
* Lectures received **mostly negative reception.** Students relied more on the course materials (textbook, notes) to learn the material.
* "I found the lectures to be mostly incomprehensible. I mostly relied on re-reading the lecture notes after class and sometimes reading the textbook."
* "The lectures were very fast paced. The lecture slides were too dense for a lecture, but useful to refer back to during psets."

## Problem Sets
* There were **6 psets,** the due dates for which were interspersed with due dates for **projects (group project, final paper).**
* The problem sets were taken directly from the textbook.
* Students' opinions on difficulty ranged from straightforward to challenging. The split was roughly even.
* The lectures and textbook were adequate preparation for the problem sets.

## Exams
* **No exams.**

## Resources
* **The official textbook was *An Introduction to Stochastic Modeling* by Pinsky and Karlin.**
* Students found the textbook **mediocre,** often opting for the **lecture notes.**

## Grading
* Students found the grading **fair.**
* "Seems to me that the expected grade distribution should be mostly A/B's."

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Basically a project test. You do 2 projects on cool things in stochastic processes that you're interested in. Concrete material wise I did not learn a whole ton"*
