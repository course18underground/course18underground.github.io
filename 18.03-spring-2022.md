## Realistic Prerequisites
* The content of **18.01** was a necessary prerequisite, and some students recommended background in **18.02** and **linear algebra** as well. 

## Subject Matter
* Most thought it was a good balance between theoretical and applied.  
* Some students found the material to be useful and very broad. 

## Course Staff
* Students found the course staff **approachable and caring**. 
* Professor Collins and TAs were both helpful in office hours.  


## Lectures
* Most students learned from the lectures, and referred to the office hours and MITx to reinforce their learning. 
* Some students found the proofs in lecture to be confusing. 


## Problem Sets
* Students found that lectures and office hours helped prepare them for psets. 
* Students found psets were reasonable and took 5-8 hours. Some students recommended collaborating with others.
* Students found the “story-time” section of the pset interesting, but more abstract.

## Exams
* Students found the exams fair, but that it was very easy to lose points from small mistakes. 
* Students recommended past psets and MITx notes to study. 

## Resources
* Most students used the MITx notes.
* There was not a textbook for this course.
* Some students wished there were more practice problems.

## Grading
* Students felt that grading was **fairly lenient**, but often times **not transparent**. 
* No expected grade distribution was given out by course staff.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"Attend lectures and recitations often, read lecture notes and online resources (MIT affiliated or otherwise) when confused, attempt to solve problems and understand proofs on your own"* 
> 2. *"Don't take this at the same time as 18.02. Give yourself room to breathe and be able to learn the two math classes’ material separately."*
> 3. *”Take this course! Time well spent.“*
