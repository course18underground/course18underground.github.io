## Realistic Prerequisites
* No prerequisites were necessary but some Calculus experience is helpful.

## Course Staff
* **Very approachable**. The professor was always available for consultations. Office hours were very helpful. 

## Lectures
* Most students believed that they learned the most from lecture and lecture notes. 

## Problem Sets
* Problem sets were **challenging but fair**. 
* Some students attempted the problems on their own and then worked with peers. 

## Exams
* There were a total of 6 quizzes, each under 30 minutes.
* Quizzes were challenging but generally easier than problem sets.

## Resources
* The professor regularly uploaded very well organized lecture notes and lecture recordings.
* A textbook supplemented class notes.  

## Grading
* Final grade was majorly dependent on problem set grades. 
* Students found the grading to be **very fair**. Completion of all problem sets results in a passing grade.

## Advice to Future Students
> 1. *"If you're interested in math but scared about taking something more theoretical/proof-based or classes beyond 18.02/18.03/18.06, I highly recommend this class."*
