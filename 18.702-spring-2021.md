## Realistic Prerequisites

- **Mathematical maturity**: familiar with **group theory and linear algebra**. **Proof writing** expsure is very important.
- Almost every student felt that **18.701** was a necessary prerequisite for the course.
  - _"18.701 is necessary and sufficient"_
- One student warns that _"This class picks up midway through the textbook and you absolutely need to still have the 701 material fresh in your head."_

## Subject Matter

- **Foundational, almost entirely theoretical, broad and useful.**
- The course covers **field theory and ring theory**, and **builds a very strong foundation for the rest of the 18.7 courses**.
- A student lovingly says _"This class complimented the knowledge gained in that class, and it actually revitalized my love for algebra, which had been leaving me ever since the end of 18.701 last semester."_
- Many students point out that the course **doesnt delve much into applications** but many of the 18.7 courses are applications of the material.

## Course Staff

- **Extemely helpful, approachable, supportive!!**. The staff was also very open to questions, and **accommodating** of extenuating circumstances.
- Both the professor and the TAs were caring and helpful.
- Many students noted that the **Piazza was quiickly answered** and that was a highlight for the course.
  - _"... I really want to emphasize Murilo; he really showed his knowledge through all of the help he gave through Piazza."_
- Almost all the students who reviewed the course **thought highly of Professor Artin** and **adored** him.
  - _"Mike Artin is one of the most kind, caring professors I have ever met at MIT. Truly a G."_
  - _"I think one of my favorite parts of the class were the course staff."_
  - _"Caring!"_
  - _"Artin is great"_

## Lectures

- **interesting, slow, and useful**
  - _"The lectures were good. Classic style, but I understood a lot from them."_
- The lectures followed the book and many students used it heavily for learning
  - _"I learned this class entirely from the textbook for this virtual semester."_
- Lectures were engaging and reinforced the book.
  - _"Textbook + lectures is all you need to learn. I recommend reading the textbook then going to lecture."_

## Problem Sets

- **Moderately hard, to challenging.** They were also **short and sweet** and **very doable if you went to office hours**.
- The problem sets were **an application and very representative of the class material.**
- Extremely useful in learning the course content, tested understanding of the material, and sometimes **required creativity** which many students liked.

## Exams

- **Very short and easy and straightforward quizzes.**
- The problems were **far easier than the problem-sets.**.
- **Solving psets and knowing critical facts from lecture was helpful**.

## Resources

- One textbook: Artin's Algebra.
  - A student notes _"Artin's book is a masterpiece and should be read in depth by anyone taking this class"_
  - Another student lovingly points out that the _"Textbook is your best friend"_
- The **course follows the book chapter by chapter**.

## Grading

- **very kind, fair, and lenient.**
- Grading was very **transparent** but the grade distribution is **extremely skewed to the high 90s.**
- Students generally felt that grading was **fair** and **consistent**.

## Advice to Future Students

> 1. _"Take this class if you get the chance. It will probably be great in person."_
> 2. _"Have a solid 18.701 background, otherwise this class can be very hard. There will be 3 or 4 major topics in this class: if you get lost in one of them try to survive until the start of the next. Then things will be somehow reset."_
> 3. _"Enjoy the content and make sure to ask staff if you ever get stuck!"_
> 4. _"Whenever you receive your next problem set, take a few minutes to memorize the questions. Over the next few days, occasionally come back and think about ways to solve it, but only start working a few days after. In my experience, if I ran head-first into a pset I hit a wall very fast, but if I know what the problem is actually asking, then I know where I want to go when I run head-first."_
> 5. _"Be prepared to be confused, a lot-- but a good kind of confused."_
